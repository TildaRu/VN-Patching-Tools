# NoDVD Patches

For those of you who own the game but don't have a DVD drive (because who has one these days?).

Run `python patch.py <game.exe>` to patch (or unpatch) the game executable. Alternatively, just grab a hex editor and change the bytes described in patch.py.

Japanese locale is required for all currently supported games.

## Supported Games

- もしも明日が晴れならば/Moshimo Ashita ga Hare Naraba (sysadv.exe)
- さくらシュトラッセ/Sakura Strasse (sakura.exe)
