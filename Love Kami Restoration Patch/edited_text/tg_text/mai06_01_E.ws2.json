"Soon after Maika announced her intention to help\\nwith Akane's rehabilitation, the three of us\\nheld a little discussion.%K%P",
"'Akane, Maika has something she wants to tell\\nyou.'%K%P",
"'She does?'%K%P",
"After dinner we called Akane back to the dinner\\ntable from her favorite spot in front of the TV.%K%P",
"'It's kinda rare for you to bring something up,\\nMaika.'%K%P",
"'Well, it's important.'%K%P",
"Akane and Maika sat facing each other.%K%P",
"I was next to Maika, keeping an eye on the\\nproceedings.%K%P",
"'It's about your rehabilitation. Your boss got\\nmad at you and Inori a while back, right?'%K%P",
"'We need to pick up the pace or we'll run out of\\ntime. I think we can all agree on that.'%K%P",
"'You feeling okay, Maika? I thought you said you\\ndidn't care if this place went under.'%K%P",
"'That was then, this is now. I realized I do\\ncare.'%K%P",
"'I don't want to lose Tsubaki. And I'm sure you\\ndon't want people to keep harping on at you,\\nright?'%K%P",
"'I guess...'%K%P",
"'Okay, then we're on the same page. From here on\\nI'm going to take an active part in helping to\\nreform you!'%K%P",
"'Uh, great...'%K%P",
"'We have to do our best to save our home!'%K%P",
"'Yeah... Yeah, sure...'%K%P",
"Maika was as enthusiastic as I'd ever seen her,\\nwhile Akane didn't seem to know how to react.%K%P",
"I hoped the differences in their attitudes\\nwouldn't become a problem.%K%P",
"After talking to Akane a little more, Maika and\\nI decided to brainstorm ideas for a new plan.%K%P",
"'How long are you gonna stand out there? Come on\\nin.'%K%P",
"'O-Okay, here I come...'%K%P",
"The way she was acting you'd think she'd never\\nbeen inside a guy's room before.%K%P",
"'It's been a while...since I've been in here.'%K%P",
"Maika sat down and looked around my room like it\\nwas something from another world.%K%P",
"'You used to hang out here all the time before I\\nstarted school.'%K%P",
"'Well, yeah. You were a year above me, and\\nthat's when I really started...noticing you.'%K%P",
"'Besides...the way this room smells is...'%K%P",
"'It smells?!'%K%P",
"I thought I was keeping it so clean, too!%K%P",
"I didn't know what to do for a moment.%K%P",
"'No, I don't mean it like that!'%K%P",
"'I mean, it smells like you. It makes me feel\\nweird, like I just want to stay here and keep\\nbreathing it in...'%K%P",
"'Urgh, what am I saying?!'%K%P",
"Phew.%K%P",
"At least I didn't have to worry about that.%K%P",
"'Do you have some kind of scent fetish, then?'%K%P",
"'Shut up! It's because it's your scent, okay?\\nIt's relaxing!'%K%P",
"'Why am I even telling you this?!'%K%P",
"It was nice that Maika had shared this with me.%K%P",
"Was I supposed to say something similar?%K%P",
"'Uh, well I like your scent, too. It's kinda\\nsweet and feminine, I could go on smelling it\\nforever.'%K%P",
"'What?! Sh-Shut up, already!'%K%P",
"Well, that backfired.%K%P",
"'Anyway, we're not here to talk about this! We\\nneed a new plan!'%K%P",
"'Oh, right. Of course.'%K%P",
"'Okay, let's calm down and think about this\\nrationally...'%K%P",
"'Maika? Is there a reason you're sitting on my\\nlap?'%K%P",
"'I thought it would help me think. Do you have a\\nproblem with it?'%K%P",
"'No, not at all. If it's okay with you, it's\\nokay with me.'%K%P",
"The soft feeling of Maika pressing up against\\nme, her sweet aroma tickling my senses, that\\nwasn't something I was going to complain about.%K%P",
"'First of all, I have a few questions about\\nAkane's rehabilitation.'%K%P",
"'Could you tell me what you've been doing so\\nfar?'%K%P",
"'Are you sure? You probably know most of it\\nalready.'%K%P",
"'That's fine. I'd like you to go over it again,\\njust in case I've missed any details.'%K%P",
"'Sure.'%K%P",
"I did as she asked and told her all about what\\nInori and I had tried to help reform Akane.%K%P",
"'And that's about it.'%K%P",
"'Wow, you've done a lot more than just dance\\npractice. But doing things that way is going to\\ntake too long, don't you think?'%K%P",
"'Maybe. But we need to take Akane's personality\\ninto account.'%K%P",
"Inori and I had done our best to respect Akane's\\nwishes as much as we could.%K%P",
"Things were improving little by little, but\\nMaika was right, we didn't have a lot to show\\nfor it yet.%K%P",
"'Being more strict with her will only have the\\nopposite effect, though.'%K%P",
"'Don't worry, I'll ease into it. One way or\\nanother, we have to reform her. For Tsubaki.'%K%P",
"'Let's toss some ideas around.'%K%P",
"Maika and I exchanged a few ideas.%K%P",
"Every now and then she'd write something down in\\na notebook when inspiration struck.%K%P",
"I found myself captivated by how earnestly she\\nwas working, and then my eyes began to wander.%K%P",
"'?!'%K%P",
"Well, it was fall, and the weather was still\\nwarm.%K%P",
"It was totally natural to wear light clothes\\nindoors.%K%P",
"So the fact that I looked down and got an eyeful\\nof fantastic cleavage... I guess there was\\nnothing else to do but look.%K%P",
"'Maybe change this around here... And this\\npart...'%K%P",
"Maika was still concentrating on her work.%K%P",
"As for me, I couldn't tear my eyes away from her\\nbeautiful chest.%K%P",
"Size just right, they looked like they'd fit\\nperfectly in my hands. They were gently rising\\nand falling in time with her breathing.%K%P",
"'Okay, this is looking good. I think this could\\nwork out.'%K%P",
"I felt like she might realize what I was doing\\nany moment.%K%P",
"I'd thought this after that incident in the\\nbathroom too, but Maika was weirdly unaware of\\nher own allure sometimes.%K%P",
"Maybe she just let her guard down when she was\\nwith me. I was going to have a hard time holding\\nback if things like this became regular.%K%P",
"'That should do it. Sho, what do you think?'%K%P",
"I think I could die happy.%K%P",
"Sitting here staring was great, though I also\\nwanted to reach around and touch them...%K%P",
"'Sho, are you listening?'%K%P",
"'Yargh!'%K%P",
"'Ah!'%K%P",
"Maika had suddenly looked up at me, and the\\nsurprise had made me cry out.%K%P",
"'Jeez, don't yell like that. You nearly gave me\\na heart attack.'%K%P",
"'Oh, right! Sorry! I, uh, what were you saying?'%K%P",
"'The plan for Akane, ring any bells? Quit\\nspacing out. What were you-- Oh.'%K%P",
"'Ah.'%K%P",
"I was in trouble now.%K%P",
"'Y-You saw, huh?'%K%P",
"'I did...'%K%P",
"'...Pervert.'%K%P",
"Maika glared at me, crossing her arms to cover\\nher chest.%K%P",
"'Sorry...'%K%P",
"'Well, you are a guy, after all.'%K%P",
"'It's only natural you'd want to look at a\\ngirl's chest.'%K%P",
"'That's not it. I was looking because it's your\\nchest.'%K%P",
"'What now?! Jeez, you're terrible...'%K%P",
"A somewhat awkward silence settled over the\\nroom.%K%P",
"'I-I'm not mad about it, okay? But take a look\\nat this, instead.'%K%P",
"Maika handed me the notebook she'd been so\\nassiduously writing in.%K%P",
"She'd drawn up a fully-packed schedule.%K%P",
"'You thought of all this?'%K%P",
"'I know we won't be able to do all of it, we'll\\nhave to narrow things down from here.'%K%P",
"'You'll help me with it, won't you?'%K%P",
"This wasn't going to be easy.%K%P"
