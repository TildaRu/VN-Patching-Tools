"Eventually, it turned out that the cause of the\\nblackout had been electrical instability\\nresulting from chronic power shortages.%K%P",
"The blackouts Akane had been causing had\\nactually been keeping the larger problem at bay.%K%P",
"Once the problem was known, Kannagi started\\nrunning planned rolling blackouts to deal with\\nthe shortages.%K%P",
"As for Akane, since she solved the major\\nblackout she hadn't caused any more small ones.%K%P",
"She was able to finish rehab, without fear of\\nbeing demoted to a spirit and without fear of\\ngetting Tsubaki Apartments demolished.%K%P",
"We were sitting on the veranda one day.%K%P",
"'Phew... Lately, it's been getting colder when\\nthe sun goes down. Winter is on the way.'%K%P",
"'Yep. I hope it gets here soon.'%K%P",
"'Why? I hate going out in the cold.'%K%P",
"'Really? I'm looking forward to spending all\\nkinds of seasons with you.'%K%P",
"'Ah...'%K%P",
"I pulled Akane even closer to me.%K%P",
"'If you put it that way, I hope winter comes\\nsoon, too.'%K%P",
"'Right?'%K%P",
"We sat there and watched the evening sky.%K%P",
"'The stars are so pretty.'%K%P",
"'Yeah, they seem particularly bright tonight.'%K%P",
"The artificial light of the city was reduced as\\nsome parts were in a rolling blackout, so the\\nstars shone through brighter.%K%P",
"'You know, it feels like we met just yesterday.'%K%P",
"'Really?'%K%P",
"But I felt she had a point.%K%P",
"'I didn't want to be rehabilitated at first. But\\nnow I know how hard life can be for people. I'm\\nhappy I could change...'%K%P",
"'It all happened because of how hard you tried.'%K%P",
"'No, it never would have happened with just me.\\nI only made it because I met you.'%K%P",
"'I'm so glad you stopped for me that night.'%K%P",
"'If I hadn't met you, I never could have changed\\nlike this.'%K%P",
"'I never would have noticed people's kindness, I\\nwould've kept being selfish. And I would have\\nkept causing trouble until I became a spirit.'%K%P",
"I patted Akane as she thought about her past.%K%P",
"'It doesn't matter. We did meet.'%K%P",
"'What's the use of thinking about what-ifs on a\\nnight like this?'%K%P",
"'Yeah. I don't even want to imagine it.'%K%P",
"She touched my hand gently.%K%P",
"I wrapped my fingers in hers and squeezed her\\nhand.%K%P",
"'Akane, are you happy now?'%K%P",
"Akane's face went blank for an instant, then she\\nbroke out in a broad smile.%K%P",
"'Of course I am!'%K%P",
"Akane went on to speak, full of confidence.%K%P",
"'Everyone around me is great, Maika and Inori\\nare so wonderful, and you're my boyfriend. I'm\\nso happy!'%K%P",
"'Yeah... I'm happy I'm your boyfriend, too.'%K%P",
"I was happy just having her beside me.%K%P",
"I was so in love with her, I couldn't imagine\\nlife without her anymore.%K%P",
"'But it's so strange. With just a little change\\nin perspective, the world suddenly looks so much\\nmore fun than before.'%K%P",
"'I changed because I met you. I got to know so\\nmany people, and see how they lived. And then I\\ngrew to want to protect them.'%K%P",
"'And now that you have control of your powers,\\nwe can be even happier together.'%K%P",
"'I could only do that because of you. I finally\\nlearned to think about other people's feelings.'%K%P",
"'There are so many people here besides just me,\\nand they all have their own lives and feelings.'%K%P",
"'I'm an Aragami, but I want to help spread my\\nhappiness to everyone little by little.'%K%P",
"'You will. You might be an Aragami, but when it\\ncomes to caring for people, you're a true\\ngoddess.'%K%P",
"'Of course! But you know, I am what I am.'%K%P",
"'I do what I want! That might cause you a bit of\\nbother, but it might also help some people.'%K%P",
"'Isn't that bad for a goddess?'%K%P",
"'Maybe, but remember! I'm an Aragami!'%K%P"
