"Recently, with her new found new enthusiasm,\\nAkane had started working really hard.%K%P",
"She started hitting the books, and helping out\\nmore with housework.%K%P",
"'Akane, are you done over there?'%K%P",
"'Um, almost... Okay, all finished!'%K%P",
"'Let me see... Yeah, spick and span!'%K%P",
"'Heehee, how you like me now?'%K%P",
"Akane had her chest puffed out, more cheerful\\nthan she'd been since giving up becoming an\\nIdol.%K%P",
"Seeing her like that made me smile, too.%K%P",
"'Oh, and what's so funny, mister?!'%K%P",

"I grab Akane just as she starts to collapse.%K%P",
"'Th-Thanks...'%K%P",
"'Don't worry about it. Are you okay? Were you\\nabout to faint?'%K%P",
"I might have been imagining it, but she looked\\npretty tired.%K%P",
"'I'm totally fine! I just tripped a bit.'%K%P",
"'Seriously? Sure you're not overdoing things?'%K%P",
"'Worry wart! But anyway, you're being awfully\\nforward, aren't you?'%K%P",
"'What's that supposed to mean?'%K%P",
"'You've got your hand on my butt.'%K%P",
"'Wah!'%K%P",
"Once she mentioned it...%K%P",
"The soft sensation under my hand, the sweet\\nscent she gave off, and her face being so\\nclose...%K%P",
"'Ahaha! Go on, grab away!'%K%P",
"'Who's grabbing? Seriously, you're so weird.'%K%P",
"'Wah!'%K%P",
"I pushed away from Akane's teasing.%K%P",
"'Sho...are you mad at me?'%K%P",
"'Why would I be mad? But, I mean, I can't say it\\nwas 100 percent accident.'%K%P",
"'Well, I don't mind at all. Anyway, I'm gonna\\nwatch TV.'%K%P",
"Akane started to run out.%K%P",
"'Right. When I'm done cleaning up here I'll\\nbring tea and come watch with you.'%K%P",
"'Really? Okay, don't forget the snacks! And\\nhurry it up.'%K%P",
"'Yeah, yeah.'%K%P",
"Watching Akane as she hurried out, her condition\\nseemed just fine.%K%P",
"It looked like her problem just now really\\nhadn't been anything serious.%K%P",
"'Okay, let's get this cleared away.'%K%P",
"I rolled up my sleeves and put away the dishes\\nAkane had washed.%K%P"
