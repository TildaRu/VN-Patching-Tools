"It was the day after Akane and Inori came to\\nstay at Tsubaki Apartments.%K%P",
"Taking a deep breath of the refreshing morning\\nair, I walked along the corridor toward the\\nliving room.%K%P",
"A lot had happened over the last 24 hours, but\\nI'd slept like a log and felt much better now.%K%P",
"This time yesterday I'd never have imagined a\\ncouple of goddesses would be moving in with me.%K%P",
"Whatever the reason, though, I was glad to have\\nsome new residents around, like in the old days.%K%P",
"'Can't let myself get carried away, though...'%K%P",
"From this day on, the future of Tsubaki was in\\nmy hands.%K%P",
"I'd have to stay focused if I was going to get\\nthis right.%K%P",
"'I'll find a way to save this place, I know it.'%K%P",
"I gave my cheeks a quick slap to drive away the\\nlast of my early-morning daze.%K%P",
"'Okay, let's do this.'%K%P",
"Bracing myself, I opened the door to the living\\nroom.%K%P",
"'Good morning.'%K%P",
"Inori was already there, holding her head in\\nfrustration for some reason.%K%P",
"'Oh... Good morning, Sho.'%K%P",
"She seemed downhearted.%K%P",
"'Hey, is something wrong?'%K%P",
"'I suppose you could say that... Just take a\\nlook.'%K%P",
"I followed Inori's gaze and saw Akane sprawled\\non the floor watching TV.%K%P",
"'Hm? Oh, hi Sho.'%K%P",
"She dimly registered my presence and gave a\\nhalf-hearted wave.%K%P",
"'Morning, Akane.'%K%P",
"'Mornin'...'%K%P",
"Akane replied in a sleepy tone of voice, making\\nno move to get up.%K%P",
"She sounded like she was ready to go back to bed\\nat a moment's notice.%K%P",
"I couldn't sense even the slightest trace of\\nvitality from her.%K%P",
"'Guess you're not a morning person, huh?'%K%P",
"That explained Inori's exasperation.%K%P",
"'Rise and shine, Akane. You can't spend all day\\ndown there.'%K%P",
"'Awww, come ooon, it's still early... Five more\\nminutes...?'%K%P",
"'Don't be like that. Today's the day we start\\ngetting your life back on track.'%K%P",
"'Oh yeah... We're really doing that, huh...'%K%P",
"'We've got plenty of time. No need to dive right\\ninto it.'%K%P",
"Akane was already trying to wriggle out of the\\nplan. I can't say I was surprised.%K%P",
"'Just when are you planning to start applying\\nyourself, Akane?'%K%P",
"'When I feel like it. Could be today, could be\\ntomorrow. 'Goddess only knows,' as they say.'%K%P",
"'Please take this seriously...'%K%P",
"'Nuh uh. I'm not up for it right now.'%K%P",
"Akane stuck to the floor and continued to refuse\\nto do anything even vaguely responsible.%K%P",
"This was going to harder than I thought.%K%P",
"'Get yourself together, Akane! This is\\nimportant!'%K%P",
"'Too bad, I'm busy! I'm gonna spend this whole\\nday taking it easy.'%K%P",
"No matter how hard Inori tried, Akane continued\\nto resist any calls to action.%K%P",
"At this rate, our rehabilitation scheme would be\\nover before it even began.%K%P",
"I tried taking a more firm approach.%K%P",
"'So, Akane... You're okay with becoming a\\nspirit, then?'%K%P",
"'Hmm, I thought about it, and if that's how\\nthings turn out...that's just how it goes,\\nright?'%K%P",
"Even my appeal to her sense of self-preservation\\nfell on deaf ears. That was some next-level\\nlaziness.%K%P",
"What was I supposed to do now?%K%P",
"'Everyone, breakfast is ready!'%K%P",
"Maika's voice dispersed the gloom that had\\nsettled over us.%K%P",
"'Yay, food! I'm starving! Inori's had me up\\nsince the crack of dawn!'%K%P",
"Akane leaped to her feet and dashed out of the\\nroom, her eyes sparkling with glee.%K%P",
"'Whoa! Hey, Akane!'%K%P",
"The conversation broke up without us\\naccomplishing anything.%K%P",
"'Good heavens... If Akane's going to be like\\nthis, I don't know if rehabilitating her will\\neven be possible.'%K%P",
"'Don't get so down. It's still only the first\\nday, and you've got me here to help.'%K%P",
"Inori looked a little happier when she heard\\nthat.%K%P",
"'Thank you... You're right, it's too early to\\ngive up now!'%K%P",
"'That's the spirit!'%K%P",
"Inori and I headed for the dining table with\\nfresh determination.%K%P",
"'I'd like to call this meeting to order.'%K%P",
"Breakfast was over and Maika had gone out on\\nsome errand.%K%P",
"That left me and Inori to discuss possible\\nstrategies, while Akane returned to her spot in\\nfront of the TV.%K%P",
"'First and foremost, we've got to find a way to\\nmotivate Akane. We won't get anywhere if she\\ndoesn't want to cooperate.'%K%P",
"Right now Akane's attitude was the biggest\\nobstacle to her rehabilitation.%K%P",
"If we could just convince her to be a little\\nmore proactive, perhaps the rest would start\\nfalling into place.%K%P",
"'I agree, but just how do we get started?'%K%P",
"'Let me ask you this, what are we aiming for\\nwhen we talk about reforming Akane? How would we\\nknow when we were done?'%K%P",
"Words like 'rehabilitation' weren't a lot of\\nhelp for visualizing a specific goal.%K%P",
"From where I was standing, we had nowhere near\\nenough time to get Akane to act more like other\\ngoddesses.%K%P",
"'Hmm... At the very least, she should be able to\\nstop her Jinriki from going haywire.'%K%P",
"'That would mean these blackouts would stop, and\\nshe'd be causing much less trouble for the\\npeople of this town.'%K%P",
"'How exactly would we get her to restrain her\\npowers?'%K%P",
"'Akane's powers are rooted in her emotions.'%K%P",
"'If she can learn to control her feelings\\nbetter, that would be a start.'%K%P",
"Emotional restraint, huh?%K%P",
"That didn't sound like something we could\\nachieve in such a short time.%K%P",
"There was another issue, too.%K%P",
"'I'd like to avoid bullying her into it. Is that\\nokay?'%K%P",
"'Naturally. It wouldn't be true rehabilitation\\nif we forced it.'%K%P",
"'I don't want Akane to obey my every\\ninstruction, I'd just like her to be more aware\\nof her responsibilities.'%K%P",
"That sounded reasonable to me.%K%P",
"It wouldn't be right to ignore her feelings on\\nthe matter.%K%P",
"We were left with the question of how to get\\nAkane to apply herself while still respecting\\nher free-spirited nature.%K%P",
"'I'm drawing a blank...'%K%P",
"'Same here...'%K%P",
"Inori and I discussed things for a little\\nlonger, but neither of us could come up with a\\nrealistic plan.%K%P",
"Just as we were reaching the end of our rope,\\nAkane suddenly turned up the volume of the show\\nshe was watching.%K%P",
"'Next up, we have a feature on an up-and-coming\\nDivine Idol!'%K%P",
"'A Divine Idol?'%K%P",
"The screen showed footage of a popular young\\nsinger on her nationwide tour.%K%P",
"'Oh, yeah, I've heard of this girl.'%K%P",
"Everyone was talking about Divine Idols these\\ndays.%K%P",
"They sang, they danced, they did everything.\\nMaika had been telling me about them the other\\nday.%K%P",
"'Idol...? Oh yes, quite a few goddesses seem to\\nbe doing that kind of job.'%K%P",
"The goddess in the video stood on a shining\\nstage, clad in a beautiful frilly outfit with a\\ncheck design.%K%P",
"Her performance was breathtaking, packed with\\notherworldly effects created by her Jinriki.%K%P",
"'That looks like so much fun... It's kinda too\\nbad I can't do anything like that...%K%P",
"'Are you a fan, Akane?'%K%P",
"'I'm just a little curious... I wonder what it's\\nlike to have that many followers.'%K%P",
"I looked back at the TV. The camera had swung\\naround to show the concert audience.%K%P",
"Men and women, young and old, all kinds of\\npeople were there, cheering frantically.%K%P",
"Between songs, they waved and chanted the idol's\\nname, all competing for a chance to be noticed.%K%P",
"Even watching it on the TV like this I could\\nfeel all the excitement as if I was really\\nthere.%K%P",
"'Wait a minute...'%K%P",
"As we watched the concert, an idea started to\\ntake form.%K%P",
"What if we tried to make Akane an idol?%K%P",
"She obviously liked that kind of thing. Maybe\\nthis could be the key to motivating her.%K%P",
"A local idol would benefit the community, too.\\nThat sounded like something Inori's superiors\\nwould approve of.%K%P",
"Plus, it might teach Akane some self control,\\nmeaning less blackouts.%K%P",
"We didn't have any other plans at the moment. I\\ncould at least suggest it.%K%P",
"'Say, Akane?'%K%P",
"'Hm? Yeah?'%K%P",
"'If you're interested...why don't you try\\nbecoming an idol yourself?'%K%P",
"'Huh?! Where did that come from?'%K%P",
"She sounded confused.%K%P",
"'You said you were curious, right? About having\\nthat many followers?'%K%P",
"'Well, what if you could experience all that\\nfirst hand?'%K%P",
"'For...real?'%K%P",
"Akane raised an eyebrow.%K%P",
"I already knew it was useless trying to get her\\nto do anything she didn't want to do.%K%P",
"But maybe we could find something productive\\nthat Akane would also enjoy.%K%P",
"'And that's not all! You could get to wear all\\nkinds of cute outfits, and fans would send you\\ngifts and stuff.'%K%P",
"'Outfits...? Gifts...?'%K%P",
"'I'd help you out, of course. What do you say?\\nIt's worth a try, right?'%K%P",
"Akane's eyes widened in excitement.%K%P",
"'That sounds great! I bet being an idol is tons\\nof fun! And if you're gonna help, it should be a\\ncinch! Let's do it!'%K%P",
"All right, I finally managed to get her\\nmotivated about something!%K%P",
"This was gonna work, I just knew it.%K%P",
"'Wait just one moment. Akane, an idol? Are you\\nserious?'%K%P",
"Inori brought us back down a notch.%K%P",
"'She can't sing or dance, and fancy stage\\noutfits would be wasted on her, don't you\\nthink?'%K%P",
"'Jeez, what's your problem, Inori?!'%K%P",
"'I'm simply voicing my opinion.'%K%P",
"'Next time keep it to yourself!'%K%P",
"'Whoa, time out! Flying off the handle like that\\nisn't going to win you any fans.'%K%P",
"I did my best to calm Akane down before things\\nescalated again.%K%P",
"'Come on, give me a smile.'%K%P",
"'We'll take things one step at a time. Let's\\nstart by trying to curb your temper. How's that\\nsound?'%K%P",
"'Urrrgh... Okay, I guess. A little at a time,\\nthat'll be easy!'%K%P",
"Akane's anger disappeared and her face broke\\ninto a smile.%K%P",
"I think we dodged a bullet there.%K%P",
"'Okay, what's next...? I guess you should learn\\na little more about human society.'%K%P",
"'If you're gonna attract fans, you need to be\\nable to empathize with them.'%K%P",
"'You're right... How about you teach me, Sho?'%K%P",
"'I'll bet I can learn a lot from observing your\\nlifestyle!'%K%P",
"'Sure. I'll do my best to support you from now\\non.'%K%P",
"'I am so psyched! This is gonna be awesome!'%K%P",
"Akane had thrown off her lethargy and was now\\nraring to go.%K%P",
"'Were you trying to rile her up on purpose...?'%K%P",
"After Akane dashed out of the room, I confronted\\nInori over her objections.%K%P",
"They had sounded a little staged, somehow.%K%P",
"'Anyone would get mad at you for saying that\\nkind of stuff, not just Akane.'%K%P",
"'I'm sorry. I just wanted to make it clear that\\nshe's going to have to reign in her emotions,\\nespecially her anger.'%K%P",
"Inori was prepared to offend Akane if it meant\\nhelping to reform her in the long run. That was\\nso like her.%K%P",
"'You didn't have to set yourself up as the bad\\nguy.'%K%P",
"Her dedication was admirable, but it was going a\\nlittle far to try and shoulder all the\\nresponsibility herself.%K%P",
"I wouldn't want to drive a wedge between the two\\ngoddesses, even if it was for Akane's sake.%K%P",
"'I know rehabilitating Akane is important, but\\ndon't forget we're in this together.'%K%P",
"'Heehee, I suppose you're right. I got carried\\naway.'%K%P",
"'Thank you for your concern, Sho.'%K%P",
"Inori favored me with a bright smile and a\\ngraceful bow.%K%P",
"That settled that.%K%P",
"'Do you think your boss will go for this plan?'%K%P",
"'Hm... To be honest, I can never really predict\\nhow she'll react to anything.'%K%P",
"'I'll have to go run it by her first.'%K%P",
"We had to try. For the time being, that was all\\nwe could do.%K%P",
"'Thanks. I'll leave that part up to you.'%K%P",
"Our strategy meeting ended with the decision to\\ncenter Akane's rehabilitation around an idol\\ncareer, pending approval from the higher ups.%K%P",
"For all we know, they might still shoot down the\\nidea.%K%P",
"My heart pounded while I waited for Inori to get\\nback.%K%P",
"She finally did a few hours later.%K%P",
"'I'm back.'%K%P",
"'Hey, Inori. How did it go?'%K%P",
"'Well... We got the go-ahead.'%K%P",
"From what she'd said before, I'd thought our\\nproposal had a high chance of being rejected. I\\nwas surprised it got approved so easily.%K%P",
"We weren't even given any special conditions to\\nwork under.%K%P",
"It was kind of an anti-climax, but I was glad we\\ncould proceed as planned.%K%P",
"Tomorrow we'd officially start work on Akane's\\nrehabilitation.%K%P",
"'Woohoo! This'll be a blast!'%K%P"
