  "'Okay! This time we're headed to the final audition!\\nLet's go for it!'%K%P",
  "'Oh, yeah, let's go.'%K%P",
  "'Ngh...'%K%P",
  "Kagura puffed out her cheeks\\nin dissatisfaction at my response.%K%P",
  "'What's wrong?\\nWhy are you making that goofy face at me?'%K%P",
  "'Hmph, now you're saying my face is goofy, huh?\\nNever mind me!'%K%P",
  "'You're such a party pooper, Yamato.\\nIt's important to show some spirit\\nat a time like this!'%K%P",
  "'You think so?'%K%P",
  "'I think so.'%K%P",
  "She really laid down the law.%K%P",
  "Well, if a goddess says it's true,\\nit must be true.%K%P",
  "'All right then, what should I do?'%K%P",
  "'Well, put your heart into it, like YEAH!\\nAnd, you know, stuff like that.'%K%P",
  "'Seriously?'%K%P",
  "'Seriously.'%K%P",
  "Well, as a way of staying positive,\\nI guessed it might be kind of important.%K%P",
  "'Okay then, let's try it again. Ready?'%K%P",
  "'Yeah, I've got it.'%K%P",
  "'Let's go for it!'%K%P",
  "'Yeaaah!'%K%P",
  "When Kagura finished,\\nI pumped my fist and cheered.%K%P",
  "To tell the truth,\\nit did kind of get me motivated.%K%P",
  "'So, now that we're fired up,\\nwhat exactly should we do?'%K%P",
  "'You mean, you don't know?'%K%P",
  "Blurting out my surprise,\\nI suddenly felt like a fool.%K%P",
  "'Well, if I already knew,\\nI wouldn't have asked for your help, would I?'%K%P",
  "Saying this, Kagura puffed out her chest smugly.\\nWhich was rather invigorating in its own way...%K%P",
  "'Okay, well, I guess you're right,\\nbut you shouldn't admit it out loud.'%K%P",
  "'Fine, fine, you don't have to nitpick.\\nSo, do you have any bright ideas?'%K%P",
  "'Hmm, well, let's see...'%K%P",
  "At her question,\\nI rested my chin in my hand.%K%P",
  "'First off, why don't we check\\nthe public's reactions to the qualifier?'%K%P",
  "'Sounds good!'%K%P",
  "'I think it's important to check\\nhow you guys were seen by the public.'%K%P",
  "'If we know what people liked or didn't like,\\nit'll be a good reference point for the future.'%K%P",
  "'Mmhmm, I see.'%K%P",
  "'You don't actually understand, do you?'%K%P",
  "'Hehehe...'%K%P",
  "Sticking out her tongue,\\nKagura gave a cute little smile.%K%P",
  "Oh well, thinking was supposed to be my job,\\nas she'd just said.%K%P",
  "'Anyway, let's just check reactions on the net.'%K%P",
  "'Okay!\\nActually, I'm starting to feel a little nervous!'%K%P",
  "'So you're saying you've never checked on your own?'%K%P",
  "'Yep. I just figured I'd look with you.'%K%P",
  "'I-I see...'%K%P",
  "For some reason, that made me happy,\\nand somehow shy...%K%P",
  "Of course, it's just Kagura,\\nso I know there's no deep meaning there.%K%P",
  "'Okay, looks like we're ready.'%K%P",
  "'Soo... Where is it?'%K%P",
  "Kagura and I stared intently at the monitor.%K%P",
  "Gathering information from the net\\nwas really vital at a time like this.%K%P",
  "And with the whole Sara retiring business,\\nthere was commentary coming in from all over.%K%P",
  "Thanks to that, it was fairly easy to find commentary\\nabout Kagura passing her first audition.%K%P",
  "'So, let's see...\\n'That Kagura's dancing is so erotic, I love it!'.'%K%P",
  "'She seems really wholesome and lively,\\nbut inadvertently bares a lot. It's so sexy.\\nAlso, big boobs!'%K%P",
  "'She's cheerful and peppy,\\nwatching her makes me happy.\\nShe's got a cute face, too. Also, big boobs!'%K%P",
  "'Her butt is so sexy and nice! Also, big boobs!'%K%P",
  "'...'%K%P",
  "Kagura kept reading her own reviews.\\nBut they were all pretty much the same.%K%P",
  "'They sure talk about my boobs a lot.\\nAre they really that good? These things?'%K%P",
  "Kagura didn't seem to mind.\\nActually, she just took her breasts in both hands\\nand lifted them up.%K%P",
  "And I suddenly found I was unable to control my eyes.%K%P",
  "'Hey, Yamato, what about you?\\nDo you like my boobs?'%K%P",
  "'Oh, well... I don't dislike them...'%K%P",
  "'Hmmm...'%K%P",
  "What did she mean by that?\\nWhat depths of meaning lay behind that 'Hmmm'?%K%P",
  "'Oh, but some people wrote about my weak points.'%K%P",
  "'What's this? She looks dumb.\\nShe doesn't seem to think at all.\\nIndecent. All she's got is sex appeal.'%K%P",
  "'Oh, that's not true at all!'%K%P",
  "Kagura puffed out her cheeks\\nin clear displeasure.%K%P",
  "'Now, now, don't pay any mind to those.'%K%P",
  "'Clearly, your cheerfulness and your energy,\\nare your strong points, so you need to focus on\\na dance that brings out those qualities.'%K%P",
  "'Yeah, you're right. 'Thanks, Yamato!'%K%P",
  "She gave me a beaming smile.\\nHer positivity really was her best point.%K%P",
  "'Okay then, now that we've checked your buzz online,\\nI think I've got an idea about what we should do.'%K%P",
  "'Huh? Really? Yamato, you're amazing!\\nYou really are something.'%K%P",
  "'But I haven't told you anything yet.\\nAt least compliment me after you've heard my plan.'%K%P",
  "'Oh, right.'%K%P",
  "'Sooo, what's your plan?'%K%P",
  "'You probably gathered this from the reviews too,\\nbut dancing is definitely your strongest point.'%K%P",
  "'So you should focus on dancing even more\\nthan before, and make a real performance out of it.'%K%P",
  "'Oh, I get it!'%K%P",
  "'And I think you should really show off your\\nwholesome sexiness, and your cheerful, peppy nature.'%K%P",
  "'Oh, but some people said they didn't like\\nthe sexy stuff.'%K%P",
  "'Those people just don't\\nreally understand your appeal yet.'%K%P",
  "'I think focusing on the dance will really help us\\nmake those people understand, too.%K%P",
  "'Yeah, you're totally right!'%K%P",
  "'Alright! I'm going to work harder\\non dancing than ever before!'%K%P",
  "'Yeah, that's the spirit!'%K%P",
  "'Since it's decided, I'd better hurry up\\nand get started!'%K%P",
  "'Wait, do you mean now?'%K%P",
  "'Of course I do!\\nMy rivals won't wait around for me!'%K%P",
  "'That's true.\\nOkay then. Let's get started!'%K%P",
  "'Alright, yeah!'%K%P",
  "Kagura's response showed\\nshe was already fired up.%K%P",
  "Since we'd decided on a course,\\nall that was left was hard work.%K%P",
  "'So the key is to dance a routine that's\\nmore appealing than what I've done so far, right?%K%P",
  "'Yeah, to put it simply, that's it.'%K%P",
  "'In other words,\\nif I can get you all excited, I'm set!'%K%P",
  "'Right... What?\\nHow do you figure that?'%K%P",
  "'Well, you watched me dance all through\\nthe qualifying round, didn't you?'%K%P",
  "'Meaning you're totally used to it,\\nbut if I can get your heart rate to rise,\\nthat must mean I've really cranked it up, right?' %K%P",
  "'I see...'%K%P",
  "What she was saying did make sense.%K%P",
  "And if I were to be honest,\\nI was pretty used to watching Kagura dance.%K%P",
  "'I'm going to be getting you way riled up,\\nso you'd better get ready!'%K%P",
  "'Haha, take it easy on me, okay?'%K%P",
  "'What would be the point of that?\\nI'm going to go all out!'%K%P",
  "At Kagura's cheerful urging,\\nI started the music.%K%P",
  "She immediately started to move\\nalong with the rhythm.%K%P",
  "And then she started dancing feverishly.%K%P",
  "'Hey, so, I guess wholesome sexiness\\nmeans something like this, right? What do you think?'%K%P",
  "Kagura fell back into something like a bridge pose.%K%P",
  "Naturally, this drew attention to her\\ntwo enormous breasts and\\nthe area where her legs met.%K%P",
  "'So, how about it? Do you feel excited?'%K%P",
  "'Uh... S-Sure, I guess I do.\\nI mean, yeah, that's really something.'%K%P",
  "I was almost too nervous\\nto answer Kagura properly.%K%P",
  "This was all my own idea, but...\\nIt was incredibly embarrassing.%K%P",
  "'What are you glancing around for?\\nCome on, look at me! Look, see?'%K%P",
  "'Um... Oh... Well...'%K%P",
  "'If this is no good, then you have to tell me!'%K%P",
  "'Um, no, it's not that, it's just...'%K%P",
  "Honestly, I could almost see everything,\\nand it was making my heart race.%K%P",
  "At the same time, though,\\nsomething was missing.%K%P",
  "'Well, if it's not that, then what is it?'%K%P",
  "'Well, you know, my heart is pounding,\\nbut not, you know, REALLY pounding.'%K%P",
  "'Hmmm... Well, up to now,\\nwhat was it that made you the most excited?'%K%P",
  "'Tell me. It'll be a good reference point.'%K%P",
  "'Huh, well...'%K%P",
  "When Kagura asked me this,\\nI started to rummage through my memories.%K%P",
  "The most exciting thing, the most exciting...%K%P",
  "As I mulled it over, suddenly\\nthat one moment popped into mind.%K%P",
  "'Well, the most exciting moment would be\\nthat time you flashed me your panties.'%K%P",
  "'Yeah, that really set my heart racing.'%K%P",
  "'Huh?'%K%P",
  "Upon saying this, I suddenly realized\\nthat had nothing to do with dancing.%K%P",
  "'Oh, no, what am I saying?\\nSorry, just forget I said anything.'%K%P",
  "'Hmm... So if I want to get a rise out of you,\\nall I have to do is show you my panties!'%K%P",
  "'Wait... But can't you see my underwear right now?'%K%P",
  "'Yep, perfectly.'%K%P",
  "'So then why aren't you as excited as you were then?'%K%P",
  "'Oh, well...'%K%P",
  "I thought for a moment, then answered.%K%P",
  "'It must be that I'm used to it now.'%K%P",
  "'Whaaaat?'%K%P",
  "Panties are wonderful things.\\nThat can't be denied.%K%P",
  "That's why it's so sad...\\nHumans can get used to anything...%K%P",
  "'Hmmm... Well, if that's the case... I've got it!'%K%P",
  "'Since you're used to my underwear,\\nI'll just have to take them off!'%K%P",
  "'Pardon?'%K%P",
  "'Yep, that's easy. Leave it to me.'%K%P",
  "'Ngh?!'%K%P",
  "As soon as she said this, she started\\ntugging at this vital piece of clothing.%K%P",
  "Her clothing was skimpy at the best of times,\\nbut now it was basically pointless.%K%P",
  "'H-hey, Kagura!'%K%P",
  "'Heehee, well? Yamato! Do you feel excited?'%K%P",
  "She asked me,\\nwiggling her hips seductively.%K%P",
  "Her heavy breasts\\nshook along with them...%K%P",
  "'Hmmm... So this doesn't work either?'%K%P",
  "I was so engrossed with what I was seeing,\\nthat her words barely registered.%K%P",
  "She didn't like that, apparently,\\nas she puffed out her cheeks in dissatisfaction.%K%P",
  "'Ah... Um, no, it's fine...\\nMaybe it's just a little too much?'%K%P",
  "'Well then, boom! How's this?'%K%P",
  "'Whoa?!!'%K%P",
  "In the next instant, Kagura had taken the\\nlittle bits of cloth hiding her most important parts\\nand pulled them completely aside.%K%P",
  "In other words,\\nI could see everything!%K%P",
  "By reflex I blocked my vision\\nwith my own hands.%K%P",
  "'Wha-Wha-Wha...'%K%P",
  "'Hahaaah!\\nI bet this has really got you going, hasn't it!'%K%P",
  "Kagura was full of confidence in this,\\nbut I was in no condition to answer.%K%P",
  "The reason being, of course, if I lowered my gaze\\njust a little, I could get an eyeful of naked girl.%K%P",
  "'Ugh, still not enough?'%K%P",
  "'Alright then, boom!\\nI'll get you going by dancing!'%K%P",
  "And saying this, she started\\nmoving furiously with the music.%K%P",
  "Oh no, if she did that, I wouldn't be able to block\\nher with my hands. I would see it all!%K%P",
  "'I said that's TOO MUCH, Kagura!'%K%P",
  "I was so worked up that I had gone full circle,\\nand back to my senses.\\nIn a panic, I shouted at Kagura.%K%P",
  "'What? This isn't too much at all.\\nI'm just trying to get you to react.'%K%P",
  "'I am! My heart is pounding! I am plenty excited!'%K%P",
  "In fact, my heart was pounding so hard\\nI was afraid it might explode.%K%P",
  "That's why I was rushing to explain,\\nbut Kagura just wouldn't listen.%K%P",
  "'Nope, this won't do.\\nI have to work on my dancing,\\nor there's no way I'll pass the audition!' %K%P",
  "'That, and now I suddenly\\nfeel so excited!'%K%P",
  "And just as she said,\\nKagura started dancing furiously again.%K%P",
  "No longer hidden by my hands,\\nher breasts and groin danced around\\nthe edges of my vision.%K%P",
  "'Alright, this is feeling good!\\nYamato, look at me! More!'%K%P",
  "'My body is feels all hot,\\nand it's like I'm floating away! It feels so good!'%K%P",
  "As if her true nature as Ame no Uzume had\\ncaught fire, Kagura's dancing grew more fervent.%K%P",
  "Come to think of it, when she'd\\nperformed at the cafe, she had tried to\\ntake of all her clothes and dance nude.%K%P",
  "'Stop, stop!\\nJust, settle down Kagura!'%K%P",
  "'Huh? Why?\\nForget that, would you just look at me?'%K%P",
  "'Uhh...'%K%P",
  "Kagura was looking at me\\nwith an almost seductive expression.%K%P",
  "Her tempting voice\\nmade me gulp by reflex.%K%P",
  "I wanted to watch her dance more.\\nI couldn't help thinking it.%K%P"
