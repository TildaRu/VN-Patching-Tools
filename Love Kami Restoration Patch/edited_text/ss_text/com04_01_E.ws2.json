  "The big screen in front of Akihabara station\\nshowed videos of the participants day in, day out.%K%P",
  "But a big screen like that\\njust couldn't bring out their real charm.%K%P",
  "Even still though, seeing the two of them up there\\nmade me extremely happy.%K%P",
  "At this point most of the spots were set.%K%P",
  "But for groups that were closer to the cut-off line, \\nit was an incredibly important time.%K%P",
  "And that was us. Right on the cut off line...%K%P",
  "'Hi, we're Love☆Kami! \\nThe preliminaries are almost over! \\nThank you all so much for your support!'%K%P",
  "'Please vote for us, Love☆Kami!'%K%P",
  "Shuri and Kagura were passing out handmade\\nflyers to passersby.%K%P",
  "And there I was, taking pictures of it all\\nfor their activity log.%K%P",
  "They also got the chance to go on stage\\nat the goddess cafe that Kagura worked part time at.%K%P",
  "The whole atmosphere, with the crowd and everything,\\nwas much different than when we took that video.%K%P",
  "Shuri had seemed quite anxious at first,\\nbut she had started to get used to it.%K%P",
  "'We're so cuuuuuute!\\nHey...do we really have to do this?'%K%P",
  "'Come on now, don't get all embarrassed. \\nLook, everyone's enjoying it.'%K%P",
  "Shuri was helping out at the cafe\\nas a way to repay them for using the stage.%K%P",
  "She didn't seem to quite understand\\nwhat drew people to maid cafes.%K%P",
  "Their activities as a duo went by\\nin a crazy hustle and bustle.%K%P",
  "Only the gods could tell if they would make it\\nthrough the primaries now.%K%P",
  "And then it was here,\\nthe final night of the preliminaries.%K%P",
  "Shuri and Kagura were at my house so we could\\nsee it all through to the end together.%K%P",
  "'Come on in, you two. \\nThe preliminaries are already over, huh.'%K%P",
  "'Sara? What are you doing here?'%K%P",
  "'I just couldn't help myself. \\nAnd when I heard you two would be coming,\\nI decided I'd join.'%K%P",
  "'Hooray! We'll definitely make it with Sara's help!'%K%P",
  "'Uhh, I don't think there's any helping\\nleft to do here.'%K%P",
  "'Oh come now, you aren't going to toss\\nuseless old me out, are you?'%K%P",
  "*Sniff sniff*%K%P",
  "'Hey! Who do you think you are making Sara cry!'%K%P",
  "'Oh give me a break. She's a huge faker.'%K%P",
  "'Want some eye drops?'%K%P",
  "'Oh, thanks sweetie. \\nNow I can REALLY cry.'%K%P",
  "'Really cry, huh?'%K%P",
  "Realizing it was all a ploy,\\nShuri suddenly grew impatient.%K%P",
  "'Mmm, this is some good tea.'%K%P",
  "We sipped on the tea that Sara made for us,\\nand watched the votes pour in.%K%P",
  "As time drew close,\\nthe poll numbers seemed to explode.%K%P",
  "As the last hour drew in, the polls would remain\\nopen, but the results were to be pulled from view.%K%P",
  "We would basically just be left in the dark.%K%P",
  "'Well? Where are we at?'%K%P",
  "'You're probably around 5th, and Kagura around 7th.'%K%P",
  "Only five idols would be selected from the\\npreliminaries. It was looking rough for Kagura,\\nbut Shuri wasn't safe either.%K%P",
  "'Come oooon! Come ooooooon!'%K%P",
  "'There's nothing you can do now.'%K%P",
  "'Guess I just better pray.\\nOh great and powerful gods...'%K%P",
  "It was serious business when a goddess\\ndecided to ask all the gods for help.%K%P",
  "But it wasn't just Kagura, Shuri sat with her hands\\nclenched, and expression hardened.%K%P",
  "And just like that, we were at the last hour.%K%P",
  "'Well, now we have no way of telling.'%K%P",
  "All that we could do was wait it out.%K%P",
  "But even still, none of us had the energy\\nto do anything else at all.%K"
