  "'I said STOP!'%K%P",
  "'Ah! Y-Yamato?'%K%P",
  "I shouted again, and shook off\\nthe temptations of the flesh.%K%P",
  "'Dance practice is over!\\nPut on some clothes and come to the shop!'%K%P",
  "'Wait, Yamato?'%K%P",
  "I turned my back on her,\\nand rushed from my room.%K%P",
  "When I was alone,\\nI sighed heavily.%K%P",
  "'Oh man, that was close...'%K%P",
  "When I touched my chest,\\nI could feel my heart pounding wildly.%K%P",
  "The sight I'd just witnessed was burned into my eyes,\\nand wouldn't go away.%K%P",
  "'Ugh, she always overdoes it, that Kagura...'%K%P",
  "I started breathing deeply,\\ntrying to settle myself down.%K%P",
  "Needless to say,\\nit didn't really do much good.%K%P",
  "'I'm here!'%K%P",
  "'Oh, hey.'%K%P",
  "After a while, Kagura showed up at the shop\\nwearing her school uniform.%K%P",
  "I couldn't help remembering what I'd seen,\\nso I found it hard to look directly at her.%K%P",
  "'So hey, how was my dancing?'%K%P",
  "'Too close, a little too close!'%K%P",
  "Kagura ignored my protest\\nand squeezed up even closer to me.%K%P",
  "Maybe it was intentional, maybe not...%K%P",
  "'Never mind that, what about my dancing?\\nDid it get your heart pounding?'%K%P",
  "'Oh yeah. It really had me going.'%K%P",
  "'Oh, really?'%K%P",
  "'Really.'%K%P",
  "'Woo-hoo!\\nWell, why didn't you say so earlier?'%K%P",
  "'I did!\\nYou were out of control and just didn't listen.'%K%P",
  "'Huh? Is that so...\\nWell, I was just having so much fun.'%K%P",
  "She said with an innocent smile.\\nWhat can I say, it was just so...Kagura...%K%P",
  "'Well, if I got you excited,\\nthen I guess it was a success!'%K%P",
  "'Yeah, it sure was... I mean, like hell it was!'%K%P",
  "'Is that supposed to be some kind of joke??'%K%P",
  "'Besides, you said you were excited!\\nIsn't that what we wanted?'%K%P",
  "'No, stripping down is going way too far.\\nIf you tried that at the audition,\\nit could be the end of your idol career.'%K%P",
  "'Oh, come on now...'%K%P",
  "Kagura cocked her head at me,\\nlike she thought I was over-exaggerating.%K%P",
  "'...Seriously?'%K%P",
  "'Seriously.'%K%P",
  "'Aww, come ooon.\\nI totally thought that would work!'%K%P",
  "'Well, at any rate, stripping is definitely out.\\nGot it?'%K%P",
  "'...Okay.\\nI don't want to give up being an idol,\\nso I guess I won't strip.'%K%P",
  "Kagura nodded, though she didn't seem happy about it.\\nHer answer was a huge relief.%K%P",
  "'However, your dancing was really great.'%K%P",
  "'Even without stripping,\\nI think that would really do the trick.'%K%P",
  "'Really? Your reaction at first was so weak,\\nI'm surprised to hear you say that.'%K%P",
  "'At first, yeah... But the later half,\\nwhen you were really moving,\\nthat was super appealing.'%K%P",
  "'In fact, it was like I couldn't stop watching...\\nYou really are Ame no Uzume...'%K%P",
  "'Hehehe, you think?\\nYou complimenting me is kind of embarrassing.'%K%P",
  "Kagura smiled happily.\\nShe was especially cute like that.%K%P",
  "'Alright then, I'll keep working in that direction!'%K%P",
  "'Right, just remember, no stripping!'%K%P",
  "'I know, I know. Anyway, now that I think about it,\\nI wouldn't want anyone else to see me like that.'%K%P",
  "'What?'%K%P",
  "'Huh? What am I going on about?\\nBut for some reason, I feel it's true.'%K%P",
  "'Hey, why do you suppose that is?'%K%P",
  "'I don't think I'm the right person to ask...'%K%P",
  "Her words were so unexpected,\\nI couldn't quite wrap my head around them.%K%P",
  "She didn't mind me seeing her,\\nbut other people were no good... What could...%K%P",
  "'Huh... I don't really get it, but when\\nI think about you watching me, I get excited.'%K%P",
  "'And my body heats up,\\nand I want you to watch more...'%K%P",
  "'With other people,\\nI'm just happy when they watch me dance. How weird.'%K%P",
  "'Y-Yeah, it is.'%K%P",
  "When Kagura said this, my heart started pounding\\nharder than it had when I watched her dance earlier.%K%P",
  "It was almost as if she was saying\\nI was something special to her...!%K%P",
  "Okay now, settle down. This is Kagura, there's no way\\nit's got any special meaning.%K%P",
  "'You know, that's probably because\\nusually it's a big crowd watching you,\\nbut today it was just the two of us.%K%P",
  "'It was an unusual situation,\\nso the feeling was different, I bet.'%K%P",
  "'Hmm, I wonder...'%K%P",
  "'That's probably it.\\nAnyway, keep up dance practice, okay?'%K%P",
  "'While we're talking, all the others\\nare surely practicing hard, right?'%K%P",
  "'Oh, you're right. Okay, I can't let Shuri win!'%K%P",
  "Kagura seemed to get fired up by my words.%K%P",
  "It was a good thing\\nthat I was able to throw her off so quickly.%K%P",
  "This audition was everything.\\nWe couldn't let anything else\\nkeep her from focusing on it.%K%P",
  "For now, at least...%K%P"
