"'Ummm... I am really sorry.'%K%P",
"I was down on the floor groveling.%K%P",
"It was a really bad thing to grope a goddess.%K%P",
"'It was an accident,\\nplease don't worry yourself over it.'%K%P",
"Inori was kind enough to let me off easy, but if\\nit had been anyone else I'd likely be in jail...%K%P",
"And at the very least, thanks to my little\\nadventure in groping, Akane and\\nInori weren't fighting anymore.%K%P",
"'So now that our little digression is done with,\\nlet's go back.'%K%P",
"'So from the start, I should have\\nexplained to you two just what my\\nbusiness with Akane is.'%K%P",
"Sweeping away the strained atmosphere, Inori\\nstraightened her back and took on a serious\\nexpression.%K%P",
"'Explain to us?'%K%P",
"'About Akane and Tsubaki Apartments.'%K%P",
"'I don't understand at all...'%K%P",
"What did the two have to do with each other?%K%P",
"'To begin with, Akane is the household\\ngoddess of Tsubaki Apartments.'%K%P",
"Household goddess?%K%P",
"I'd never heard the term before.%K%P",
"'What kind of goddess is that?'%K%P",
"'A household goddess, like the name implies,\\nwatches over a house or building. Think of Akane\\nas the guardian of Tsubaki Apartments.'%K%P",
"'What?!'%K%P",
"So a goddess had been watching over\\nTsubaki Apartments?!%K%P",
"Judging by Maika's astonishment,\\nshe hadn't known either.%K%P",
"'But you're a goddess.\\nDon't you live in a boarding house?'%K%P",
"'Well, I do, somewhere, sure, but I haven't been\\nthere since the descent.'%K%P",
"I remembered her saying she'd never been home once\\nwhen we first met.%K%P",
"If that's the case, then it's only natural Maika\\ndidn't know.%K%P",
"'I see... I get their connection now.\\nSo now what about you two?'%K%P",
"'I'm Akane's guardian.'%K%P",
"A guardian.%K%P",
"As I looked at the defiant Akane, I felt I\\nunderstood the need.%K%P",
"'Yeah, I bet Akane really does need a guardian.'%K%P",
"'Hold on! What do you mean by that?'%K%P",
"'That's because, while she is technically a \\nhousehold goddess, she's also what's called an \\nAragami.'%K%P",
"Inori ignored Akane's protests as she\\ncontinued speaking.%K%P",
"'Aragami? That sounds ominous.'%K%P",
"'Ominous, indeed.'%K%P",
"'An Aragami is a goddess that cannot control\\nher Jinriki. They are unruly and often cause\\ntrouble for humans.'%K%P",
"Jinriki is the divine power goddesses use.%K%P",
"The happiness and good will of humans become\\nSakimitama, which goddesses take as nourishment\\nto make Jinriki.%K%P",
"This information had been such big news after\\nthe descent, I still remembered it years later.%K%P",
"'So, basically, you have to stay close to Akane\\nto make sure that her bad behavior\\nstops.'%K%P",
"It might be putting it too frankly, but that\\nseemed about right.%K%P",
"'Exactly. The reason no one here at\\nTsubaki Apartments knew about Akane is because\\nshe's been out playing around since the descent.'%K%P",
"That sounded like what Akane had said when we met.%K%P",
"'Well, I am an Aragami, right?\\nRehabilitation is pointless!'%K%P",
"'Akane, you possess great power,\\nand you are causing a great many people\\na lot of trouble.'%K%P",
"'How many blackouts did you cause today?'%K%P",
"Inori glared at Akane, who started to look sulky.%K%P",
"'Whoa, what?\\nAkane's been causing all the blackouts?!'%K%P",
"Maika was clearly surprised, but I had been thinking\\nsomething like that for a while now.%K%P",
"The blackouts happened like clockwork, whenever\\nAkane started to get worked up.%K%P",
"And then, whenever she felt better, the power would\\nsnap back on.%K%P",
"'Indeed. Kannagi's been suffering\\nblackouts recently because of Akane's power\\ngetting out of control.'%K%P",
"So all the blackouts had been caused by an Aragami\\nlosing control of their Jinriki.%K%P",
"'But Akane's the household goddess here, right?\\nWhy does her power make the electricity go out?'%K%P",
"Usually, a goddess' Jinriki is connected to the\\ngoddess' origin, according to legend.%K%P",
"So, Akane's power was connected to electricity,\\ndespite her being a household goddess.%K%P",
"'Oh, now that you mention it, there used to be\\nan electricity pylon here!'%K%P",
"'Is that so?\\nI've never heard anything about\\nwhat was here before the apartments.'%K%P",
"I've been at home here since I was a child, but never\\nthought much about what was here before.%K%P",
"'Yes, that pylon is the source of Akane's\\nelectrical nature. Sadly, since she manifested as an\\nAragami, she can only remove electrical power...'%K%P",
"Inori added, explaining more about Akane's Jinriki.%K%P",
"'In addition, since Akane has refused\\nrehabilitation repeatedly, and caused continual\\nblackouts since then, a decision has been reached.'%K%P",
"'If Akane is not successfully rehabilitated\\nwithin two months, then she will be\\ndemoted from goddess to a spirit.'%K%P",
"'She has two months because, based on past\\ndata, one month has been proven insufficient\\nfor true rehabilitation.'%K%P",
"I'd never heard of goddesses becoming spirits before.%K%P",
"'Yes, yes, demotion, demotion,\\nblah blah... Huh?\\nSpirit? Me...demoted to a spirit?'%K%P",
"'Yes, that's correct.\\nThis decision comes from the top,\\nI don't have authority to reverse it.'%K%P",
"Hearing this, Akane hung her head.%K%P",
"'So, what exactly does that entail?\\nDemoted to a spirit, huh?'%K%P",
"Judging by Akane's reaction, it must be something\\npretty serious.%K%P",
"'Well, basically it means she'll lose her Jinriki.'%K%P",
"'And there is a possibility she'll become unable to\\nmanifest on earth like this.'%K%P",
"'Oh, that's...'%K%P",
"Basically, it meant Akane would disappear.%K%P",
"I had no idea the punishment would be so harsh.%K%P",
"'Huh...'%K%P",
"The sulking Akane made a sound.%K%P",
"'Huh...?'%K%P",
"'Quit messing with me!\\nHow can they do that?!\\nThat's crazy!'%K%P",
"There was another blackout.%K%P",
"However, since we finally knew the cause, Maika\\nand I weren't all that concerned.%K%P",
"'No way no way no way!\\nI'm not gonna do it!'%K%P",
"'Why do I have to turn into a stupid spirit?!'%K%P",
"'Well, all you have to do is accept rehabilitation!'%K%P",
"'I don't want to be rehabilitated!\\nAnd I don't want to be a spirit!'%K%P",
"Her selfishness was almost shocking.%K%P",
"Inori stared at her in amazement as well.%K%P",
"'Can't you do something, dirt goddess?!'%K%P",
"'What the...\\nWho's the dirt goddess,\\nyou freeloader?!'%K%P",
"Inori lost it.%K%P",
"Apparently 'dirt goddess' was going too far.%K%P",
"'If you can't help at a time like this,\\nwhat good are you?!'%K%P",
"'Now I already told you, I don't have\\nany authority in this!'%K%P",
"She raised her voice, truly at the end of\\nher patience.%K%P",
"'Inori, please calm down.'%K%P",
"'Oh... Do forgive me. I seem to have gotten\\nlost in my feelings.'%K%P",
"Luckily, this time she actually did calm down.%K%P",
"If they had started fighting again, it could've\\nbeen bad.%K%P",
"'Ahem. I myself don't want you to become a spirit.\\nI'll help, but you simply must try to accept rehab.'%K%P",
"Inori continued, having relaxed a bit.%K%P",
"'Hmph!'%K%P",
"Akane, sulking heavily, was looking away\\nbut glanced over every once in a while,\\nlike she was listening secretly.%K%P",
"'And now, here is where we get to\\nhow this effects you two,\\nSho and Maika.'%K%P",
"'If Akane becomes a spirit,\\nthere is a possibility that\\nTsubaki Apartments will be torn down.'%K%P",
"'Torn down?!'%K%P",
"'Why would that happen?!'%K%P",
"I'd never even considered that this place\\nmight disappear.%K%P",
"'If the household goddess disappears,\\nthen there is no one to watch over her building.'%K%P",
"'And there's no telling what might happen\\nto a building with no guardian goddess.'%K%P",
"'The floor may disintegrate with age,\\nor the roof may collapse.'%K%P",
"'It could become very dangerous.'%K%P",
"Inori paused for a deep breath.%K%P",
"Then she looked straight at us.%K%P",
"'And naturally the residents here could be harmed.'%K%P",
"'Huh?!'%K%P",
"'The building may have to be torn down\\nbefore anyone gets hurt.'%K%P",
"The problem was worse than I expected.%K%P",
"But it also sounded like one we couldn't really do\\nanything about.%K%P",
"'So, if Akane doesn't finish her rehabilitation,\\nwe may be kicked out of Tsubaki?'%K%P",
"'Yes, that's right. Of course, if that happens\\nwe will find you another place to live.'%K%P",
"Inori was watching us carefully as she said this.%K%P",
"This was also clearly part of her job.%K%P",
"I doubt there are many people who would be happy\\nto hear that they'd have to up and move like that.%K%P",
"To say goodbye to the apartments\\nafter so many years, after growing so\\ncomfortable here, was unthinkable.%K%P",
"'I'm deeply sorry you had to hear it like this.\\nBut please believe me,\\nI will get Akane rehabilitated!'%K%P",
"But...%K%P",
"More than anything I didn't want Akane\\nto disappear.%K%P",
"We'd only just met, but in that time I had grown\\nto like the goddess.%K%P",
"I couldn't accept the idea of her disappearing\\nlike that.%K%P",
"'Inori, it's just a thought, but could I perhaps\\nhelp in Akane's rehabilitation?'%K%P",
"'Huh?'%K%P",
"'Sho, what are you talking about?'%K%P",
"'Just what I said.\\nWe could help Akane get better.'%K%P",
"Two is better than one, and three is best of all.\\nIf we helped, it could make Akane's rehab that\\nmuch easier.%K%P",
"That way, we could keep Akane from becoming a\\nspirit and protect Tsubaki at the same time.%K%P",
"'But why would you help, Sho?'%K%P",
"'She's talking about tearing down\\nTsubaki Apartments, right?\\nIf we can do anything at all, we should!'%K%P",
"'I see...\\nBut if she doesn't want to,\\nthen why force it on her?'%K%P",
"I couldn't believe my ears.%K%P",
"'So you're fine with them tearing down the house?'%K%P",
"'I hadn't really thought that far ahead.\\nBut if it comes to that, oh well.'%K%P",
"'Honestly, you're the only tenant. We're barely\\nkeeping afloat as it is, you know? If they find us\\na new home, we should count our blessings!'%K%P",
"'If they tear down this ugly old house\\nand build a parking lot, it'd be good for the neighborhood.\\nI'd say it's about time.'%K%P",
"She said this like it was nothing,\\nbut that couldn't be true.%K%P",
"If the number of tenants was really a problem,\\nthey'd have torn it down the moment I became\\nthe last.%K%P",
"I bet the only reason it's still here is because\\nMaika has an emotional attachment to it, too.%K%P",
"'I can't accept Tsubaki getting torn down.\\nI have to do what I can.'%K%P",
"'Well, if you feel that way...\\nI won't try to stop you.'%K%P",
"She didn't seem particularly convinced,\\nbut she seemed to accept it.%K%P",
"'I'm very happy to hear you feel that way,\\nbut are you certain about this?'%K%P",
"'This problem affects us directly.\\nOf course I want to help.'%K%P",
"Anyway, it was just me being selfish.%K%P",
"Luckily, there was no school for the month,\\nso I had plenty of time.%K%P",
"There was nothing keeping me from helping.%K%P",
"'Now wait a minute!\\nI never said I agreed to all this!'%K%P",
"'But by your reaction I'd say you clearly don't want\\nto become a spirit, right?'%K%P",
"'I don't want to lose these apartments.\\nYou don't want to become a spirit.\\nWhat's the problem?'%K%P",
"'All that's true, but...'%K%P",
"She didn't want to be demoted, but something\\ninside Akane still couldn't accept it.%K%P",
"'I'm an Aragami!\\nLiving free is what it means to be an Aragami!\\nRehabilitation is-- Wha--!'%K%P",
"'Wh-What?!\\nWhat are you doing?!'%K%P",
"'I thought I'd calm you down a bit.\\nThe blood was rushing to your head, right?'%K%P",
"'U...ugh... Yeah, maybe, but...'%K%P",
"Akane was pleading with upturned eyes,\\nher cheeks red.%K%P",
"She seemed to always wear a defiant, spirited face,\\nit was refreshing to see her suddenly shy.%K%P",
"I wanted to see more of that Akane,\\nso I kept petting her head.%K%P",
"'Hey...stop petting me!'%K%P",
"'You don't like it?'%K%P",
"'I...well, um... It actually feels really nice...\\nIt's not bad, but suddenly I feel all weak...\\nWhat is this?!'%K%P",
"When Akane was just the right level of relaxed,\\nI began to talk.%K%P",
"'Hey, Akane...\\nInstead of thinking about rehabilitation,\\nwhy not think about the satisfaction after.'%K%P",
"'Just try it a little bit? I'll do everything I can\\nto support you.'%K%P",
"'Oooh... F-Fine, I'll do it.\\nYou helped me already...\\nI-I guess I can try a little...'%K%P",
"'Thank you, Akane.'%K%P",
"Akane snorted a little and looked away,\\nbut her face then relaxed.%K%P",
"'S-So, maybe you could stop petting me now?\\nI-I'm feeling kind of embarrassed...'%K%P",
"'Ah... Oh, yeah. Sorry.'%K%P",
"I took my hand off her head.%K%P",
"'Well, you know, a little is okay.'%K%P",
"I guess it was okay for me to touch her...%K%P",
"The other two were watching me like I'd lost my mind.%K%P",
"'Um... Sho is rather bold, isn't he?'%K%P",
"'...He's a shameless perv.'%K%P",
"'Agh!'%K%P",
"Maika was being awfully harsh today.%K%P",
"'Well, whatever. Sho's character isn't the\\ntopic right now.'%K%P",
"'More importantly, since Sho is going to help, does\\nthat mean he'll be going to your place every day?'%K%P",
"'Oh, yeah, sorry...\\nI'll be living here from now on!'%K%P",
"'What?! Why that all of a sudden?!'%K%P",
"'Well, I am the household goddess, after all!\\nIf I'd known it was this nice, I'd have come\\nsooner!'%K%P",
"'Oh... Well, if Akane is going to live here from\\nnow on, it would be very helpful for me as her\\nguardian if I could stay here too.'%K%P",
"'Only if it isn't too much of a bother, don't feel\\nlike you have to or anything!'%K%P",
"Naturally it would make things easier if they\\nlived together.%K%P",
"'Well, I think it's fine, but...'%K%P",
"I looked at Maika, who appeared to be\\nmulling it over.%K%P",
"'Oh, fine.'%K%P",
"'Whatever. You two do what you want.'%K%P",
"Maika murmured, like she'd given up.%K%P",
"'Sho...'%K%P",
"'You need something?'%K%P",
"'Since they're moving in, can you help me set up\\nbeds in the spare rooms?'%K%P",
"'No problem! Leave it to me.'%K%P",
"And so two goddesses came to live at Tsubaki.%K%P"
