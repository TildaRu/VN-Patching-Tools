"'Augh. There's no way I could handle chores\\nevery day.'%K%P",

"'Well, it wasn't a very favorable reaction.\\nThey're pushing me to try harder\\nat her rehabilitation.'%K%P",
"'Ugh, what's up with that?'%K%P",
"'I don't wanna try any harder than now.\\nEspecially since I haven't even been\\npracticing at all these days.'%K%P",
"'I-It should be fine.\\nYou're doing your best, Akane.'%K%P",
"'Inori's right. Even if other goddesses don't see it,\\nwe know you're doing a remarkable job, Akane.'%K%P",
"'I know that, but...\\nUgh, it still bugs me!'%K%P",

"'Well...'%K%P",
"I updated Maika with the situation according\\nto what Inori told me.%K%P",
"'Hmm. Maybe rehabilitation is impossible by becoming\\nan idol?'%K%P",
"'Well, you can't deny the fact that Akane\\naccomplished quite a bit recently, right?'%K%P",
"'Maybe a little. But since she can't recognize her\\nown efforts, she's more miserable than ever.'%K%P",
"'It's true. I wonder why that is.'%K%P",
"'If nothing comes to mind, how about we just stop?'%K%P",
"While I was racking my brains over it, Maika\\nsuggested that as if it wasn't a big deal.%K%P",
"'What do you mean?'%K%P",
"'No matter how hard we think, the blackouts\\naren't going to stop overnight. So why don't we\\ntake a break?'%K%P",
"'You still have some time. It might be better in the \\nlong run if you take a break for a bit.'%K%P",
"A break, huh?%K%P",
"I'd been pushing myself a lot recently, so she\\nmight have a point.%K%P",
"'There, sounds like they stopped fighting.\\nWhy don't you go talk to them?\\nI'll go prepare lunch for us.'%K%P",
"'All right. Will do.'%K%P",
