"A few days passed after Inori was approved\\nto provide regional contribution to Kannagi.%K%P",
"In order to report on my progress, I was meeting\\nwith Inori in the living room.%K%P",
"'Thank you for waiting. I'm here to report to you\\nabout the state of progress regarding\\nyour regional contribution.'%K%P",
"'Perfect timing. I wanted to discuss\\nsomething with you too.'%K%P",
"Seems Inori was doing what she could\\nwithout waiting for me.%K%P",
"'Then I'll go first. Regarding the\\nregional contribution, I went ahead and notified\\nthe people of the shopping street about it.'%K%P",
"'So if something happens, I'm sure they'll go\\nstraight to you for help.'%K%P",
"'I'm impressed. You spread the word\\nin such a short time.'%K%P",
"She seemed so impressed, I felt a little embarrassed.%K%P",
"I wonder how Inori would react\\nif I poked fun at her now.%K%P",
"'Must be my usual natural virtues.\\nThese results were expected.'%K%P",
"'You're the best, Sho!'%K%P",
"I said it as a joke, but Inori's admiring eyes\\nmade me even more embarrassed.%K%P",
"This wasn't something that I was used to.%K%P",
"'Ahem... Th-That said, you can anticipate\\nthe townspeople coming for your help\\nin the near future.'%K%P",
"'Thank you so much for all your help!'%K%P",
"'No thanks necessary.'%K%P",
"'You've been nice to me ever since we met.\\nYou were always there even when Akane and I\\ntroubled you so many times.'%K%P",
"'Whenever I made mistakes, you helped me right away.\\nJust like how you did now.'%K%P",
"'How should I repay you for everything...?'%K%P",
"'I only acted with my own will.'%K%P",
"If it was something I didn't want to do,\\nI wouldn't do it so readily.%K%P",
"I really wanted to help Inori out because her\\nfeelings towards the town were genuine.%K%P",
"As I spent more time with Inori, my desire\\nto help her out got even stronger.%K%P",
"'Hey Inori, If you do feel indebted, let's work\\ntogether to settle everyone's worries.'%K%P",
"'Yes, please. We'll work together to\\nsettle the people's-- Huh?'%K%P",
"'W-With you?'%K%P",
"'Of course. That was the plan in the first place.\\nIs there an issue?'%K%P",
"'Not at all... But you're taking on Akane's\\nrehabilitation as well.'%K%P",
"'If you started helping me, you won't\\nhave any time for yourself...'%K%P",
"Heh, she was worried over nothing.%K%P",
"'I'll manage my time somehow. But like I said\\nbefore, I'm helping because I want to help you.'%K%P",
"'Hmmm...'%K%P",
"'Anyway, what did you want to discuss with me?'%K%P",
"I purposely ignored her stare and urged to\\nchange the subject.%K%P",
"'Oh, yes. I actually brought in an inquiry.'%K%P",
"'Really? I'm impressed that you got one already.\\nOkay, tell me about it.'%K%P",
"'Well, it's this.'%K%P",
"The flyer included a photo of a calico cat\\nwith the headline, 'Searching for Cat.'%K%P",
"'So...it's a cat search?'%K%P",
"If that was on the flyer, then that's it.%K%P",
"'This person's dear cat went missing\\na little while ago.'%K%P",
"'I could tell from this flyer that the owner\\ncares a lot for this cat, so I'd like to find it\\nas soon as possible.'%K%P",
"Yup, just as Inori said, the flyer depicted urgency.%K%P",
"It was obvious that this cat was very precious\\nto its owner.%K%P",
"'Let's get this cat back to its owner!'%K%P",
"'Yes! We must find the cat so the owner can\\nfind peace of mind.'%K%P",
"'All the more reason for me to help you.\\nThe more people the better\\nwhen you're searching for a cat.'%K%P",
"'You're coming with me?'%K%P",
"'Do you not want me to?'%K%P",
"'Not at all! It's rather...'%K%P",
"'Rather?'%K%P",
"Inori paused in the middle of her thought.%K%P",
"'N-Never mind...\\nIn any case, you're going\\nto help me find this cat!'%K%P",
"'Of course. Let's do so together.'%K%P",
"If she was about to tell me that she welcomed\\nmy company, it would've made me happy.%K%P",
"'I appreciate your help.'%K%P",
"And that's how Inori and I started\\nto offer regional contribution.%K%P",
"We searched in areas where cats gathered\\nand asked around the shopping street,\\nbut noody had seen the cat.%K%P",
"After we left the shopping street, I noticed that\\nInori was looking tired.%K%P",
"'Hey, why don't we take a break?'%K%P",
"Since we'd been searching for hours, I'd figured it\\nwas about time for one.%K%P",
"We'd be more efficient if we took a break anyway.%K%P",
"'Sure, let's take a short break.'%K%P",
"'It's decided. So why don't we go\\nto the park and-- Inori?'%K%P",
"I found it strange that she didn't respond,\\nso I followed her gaze and saw a olive brown\\ncalico cat right in front of us.%K%P",
"'That cat...'%K%P",
"'I found it!'%K%P",
"'Hey, wait!'%K%P",
"'Inori!'%K%P",
"I ran after Inori who started to chase after\\nthe cat that was running away. %K%P",
"'*Huff, huff* W-Wait!'%K%P",
"Unfortunately, she was way too slow!%K%P",
"I'm sure she ran as fast as she could, but I easily\\npassed her just by jogging.%K%P",
"'S-Stop...p-please stop!'%K%P",
"Inori desperately chased after the kitten, but there\\nwas no way she could catch up.%K%P",
"Perhaps due to Inori's low stamina, we weren't able\\nto get any closer to the kitten.%K%P",
"'Inori, I'll run ahead and catch up with\\nthe kitten... Whoa!'%K%P",
"When I caught up and tried to catch it,\\nthe kitten made an impressive jump and\\nflew over to the other side of the wall.%K%P",
"'What to do...'%K%P",
"I scratched my head in front of the wall.%K%P",
"There was a small hole in the wall, \\nbut it didn't look like I could fit through.%K%P",
"But by the time we went around the wall,\\nwe'd lose sight of the cat.%K%P",
"'Haa! *Gasp, pant* Sh-Sho...\\nWhile you go around,\\nI'll pass through here to chase it.'%K%P",
"'Will you be okay...?'%K%P",
"'Y-Yes. D-Don't worry. I'm going for it.'%K%P",
"'What!'%K%P",
"I froze when I watched Inori crouch down\\nto pass through the opening.%K%P",
"'U-Um, Inori? Y-Your underwear...'%K%P",
"Her butt stuck out as she leaned in which\\nlifted up her clothes and made\\nher underwear completely visible.%K%P",
"'Oh? Did it get turned up?\\nI'll pass right through\\nso please don't mind me.'%K%P",
"She wasn't concerned about her underwear\\nbeing exposed at all.%K%P",
"'Ah, my chest is caught and it's\\nmaking it hard for me to move forward.'%K%P",
"As Inori moved, her protruded butt swayed\\nleft and right.%K%P",
"Because we ran, her underwear, damp from sweat\\nclung tightly on her skin, emphasizing\\nher womanly figure even more.%K%P",
"'...'%K%P",
"I knew I had to go and chase the kitten, but I\\ncouldn't take my eyes off this sight.%K%P",
"'Uh, uh, almost there...'%K%P",
"'Wait!'%K%P",
"As she pushed and squeezed through the opening,\\nher underwear slid off a bit to reveal quite\\nthe sight.%K%P",
"I couldn't concentrate on anything else.%K%P",
"As she swayed, her underwear slipped down\\nalong with it.%K%P",
"'Ah, my chest... But it's just-- Uhmm...'%K%P",
"She made a bunch of sensual sounds.%K%P",
"I'm sure she wasn't doing it intentionally, but\\nsince it looked like she was seducing me,\\nI couldn't stop thinking about touching her.%K%P",
"'There, ah, it's hard to go forward...'%K%P",
"'*Gulp*'%K%P",
"The proper thing to do would be to call and\\nhelp her out, but I was a dude, after all.%K%P",
"If a cute girl's underwear was in plain sight like\\nthis, of course I'd get excited and want to keep\\nwatching.%K%P",
"'Ah, just, a little more... Hmm.'%K%P",
"'Whoa!'%K%P",
"As she continued to push through, her underwear\\nwas about to completely slide off.%K%P",
"If that were to happen, the situation would\\nget worse with practically everything exposed,\\nso I tried to call out to her, but...%K%P",
"'Yes! I got out!'%K%P",
"While I was busy debating with myself,\\nshe made it through the opening.%K%P",
"I heard Inori's excited voice from the other\\nside of the opening.%K%P",
"'All right, I'm going to keep chasing the cat.'%K%P",
"'I should too...'%K%P",
"After I taking a breath, I dashed off to get my\\nmind out of the gutter.%K%P",
"I took a long detour, then Inori messaged me that\\nshe found the kitten.%K%P",
"I rushed to the park hoping we wouldn't\\nlose sight again and found Inori nervously\\nclimbing up a tree.%K%P",
"'Ah! Inori! Watch out!'%K%P",
"'I-I'm all right! I'm almost there.'%K%P",
"When I dashed under the tree, Inori had already\\nclimbed all the way up to the branch\\nwhere the kitten sat.%K%P",
"The kitten looked so petrified that it\\ndidn't make a sound.%K%P",
"'It's all right. It's okay.'%K%P",
"Inori gently smiled at the kitten and made it\\napparent that she had no animosity.%K%P",
"'There, there.'%K%P",
"Inori approached the kitten, trying not to\\nscare it away.%K%P",
"The kitten sensed that it was safe.\\nIts body continued to tremble,\\nbut it didn't try to escape.%K%P",
"'I caught it.'%K%P",
"Inori reached over and clutched the cat to her chest.%K%P",
"But, that was a mistake.%K%P",
"'Ah!'%K%P",
"Then suddenly Inori started to lose her\\nbalance on the branch.%K%P",
"'Inori!'%K%P",
"'Ahhh!'%K%P",
"Inori held the kitten in her arms to protect it.%K%P",
"'I'm gonna make it!'%K%P",
"I kicked the ground, reached out with my hand\\nand jumped forward.%K%P",
"'Huh? Nothing hurts...'%K%P",
"'Ouch...'%K%P",
"'Sho...?'%K%P",
"I was able to catch Inori from what would have been\\na painful fall.%K%P",
"'Are you okay?'%K%P",
"Inori didn't respond, her face was bright red\\nand her eyes were glistening.%K%P",
"'Oh no, did you get hurt?'%K%P",
"I panicked and checked all over her body.\\nThankfully, she hadn't been injured.%K%P",
"'Th-Thank you very much for saving me.'%K%P",
"'But, um... It's embarrassing when you hold and\\nstare at me like that.'%K%P",
"'Oh, ahh, sorry. I didn't mean to.'%K%P",
"I got startled when I saw Inori\\nblushing in my arms.%K%P",
"When I came to my senses, Inori's body felt soft\\nand extremely delicate, as if she could break\\nif I hugged her tightly.%K%P",
"Her rough breathing, flushed cheeks, and perfectly\\nshaped lips captured my attention.%K%P",
"'Inori...'%K%P",
"My heart beat so fast. It was like I was under a\\nspell, I couldn't take my eyes off of her. %K%P",
"My face naturally got closer to her lips...%K%P",
"'Um, Sho?'%K%P",
"'What? Oh... E-Excuse me. I-I'll put you down.'%K%P",
"'Ah...'%K%P",
"When I realized what I was about to do,\\nI tried to let Inori out of my arms.%K%P",
"But she tightly gripped my shirt and looked\\nat me with lonesome eyes.%K%P",
"'Um, if you don't mind...can we stay like this\\nfor a little bit longer?'%K%P",
"I swallowed my breath at the sight of\\nher glistening eyes.%K%P",
"I always thought she was just so beautiful.%K%P",
"And after spending a whole day and seeing\\nthe different sides of her, she looked\\neven more beautiful.%K%P",
"I couldn't look straight into her eyes.%K%P",
"'W-With that, we fulfilled a request!'%K%P",
"'Y-Yup. Case closed, for now.'%K%P",
"We were still blushing as we laughed together.%K%P",
"When we returned the cat to our client, they bowed\\nand thanked us many times.%K%P",
"We successfully fulfilled our first request.\\nIt made me feel good inside to help.%K%P"
