"'Morning...'%K%P",
"The next morning, Akane appeared in the living room\\nwith a listless wave.%K%P",
"'Good morning, Akane.\\nAre you okay?'%K%P",
"Compared to the day before, her face was\\nclearly too pale.%K%P",
"'Why?'%K%P",
"'Why? Well, look at you...\\nYour face is pale as a sheet.\\nYou're sick, aren't you?'%K%P",
"'I'm totally fine! I just overslept and now I'm\\nhaving trouble waking up, that's all.'%K%P",
"With her face as pale as it was, her words failed\\nto convince me.%K%P",
"'I mean, I've never heard of a goddess getting\\nsick, have you? I'm fine.'%K%P",
"'Well, okay, but still...'%K%P",
"It'd be best to ask Inori, but she already left,\\nsaying she had a report to turn in.%K%P",
"'Sho, you worry too much.\\nLet's just have breakfast.'%K%P",
"Akane gave a somehow hopeless smile and\\nsat down to eat her breakfast.%K%P",
"Despite her insistence, I continued to feel there\\nwas something different about her.%K%P",
"I hope she was right, though, and I was just\\nworrying too much.%K%P",
"'All right, I'm heading out, you look after Akane.'%K%P",
"'Yeah, I'll keep a close eye on her.\\nDon't worry!'%K%P",
"I saw the worried-looking Maika off, then went back\\ninside and into the living room.%K%P",
"'There you are! Took you long enough.'%K%P",
"Akane had already started getting the living room\\nready.%K%P",
"'Sorry, I got held up. But hey, are you really\\nokay?'%K%P",
"'How many times do I have to tell you,\\nI am fine! I was able to eat,\\nthere's nothing to worry about!'%K%P",
"She'd only eaten about half what she usually does,\\nbut even if I told her to ease up,\\nI knew she'd just brush me off.%K%P",
"'Fine... But if things get too hard, just let me know.'%K%P",
"I couldn't force her to do anything,\\nall I could do was be ready to pick up the pieces\\nwhen the inevitable collapse came.%K%P",
"'Okay!'%K%P",
"'Right, let's get started.'%K%P",
"Akane started her dance practice, but her moves\\nhad no spirit.%K%P",
"And since she wasn't into the song, she wasn't\\nmatching the lyrics or music.%K%P",
"Watching her practice like that, I was thinking\\nthat it might be better to stop - then suddenly...%K%P",
"'Wah!'%K%P",
"Akane's legs gave out mid-dance.%K%P",
"'Akane?!'%K%P",
"I rushed and somehow caught her before she\\nhit the ground.%K%P",
"'Ahaha, sorry sorry.\\nI screwed up a little...\\nHuh?'%K%P",
"She tried to push away, but she\\ncouldn't support her own weight,\\nso she had to keep leaning on me.%K%P",
"'Th-This is weird... Sorry...'%K%P",
"'Don't apologize.\\nClearly you are not okay.\\nYour face is as white as a ghost.'%K%P",
"And even as we spoke, I could see her getting\\nweaker and weaker.%K%P",
"'Don't move...'%K%P",
"With my forehead almost touching hers,\\nI could feel a feverish heat.%K%P",
"It was clearly not from the dancing.%K%P",
"'What?! Sh-Sho?'%K%P",
"'You've got a fever!\\nI told you to take it easy!'%K%P",
"'Ugh... But...I've never felt bad like this before.\\nA-Anyway, your face is too close!'%K%P",
"'Oh, right. Sorry.'%K%P",
"Her face was getting flushed with fever,\\nso I released the protesting Akane.%K%P",
"'That's enough for today. You should rest if you\\nfeel bad.'%K%P",
"'Y-Yes...'%K%P",
"I pursed my lips and led Akane to her room while.%K%P",
"After sending her to bed, I went and made\\nsome rice porridge and tea and brought it\\nto her room.%K%P",
"'Akane, I'm coming in.'%K%P",
"'Come on in...'%K%P",
"'How are you feeling?'%K%P",
"She was lying quietly under the covers.%K%P",
"'Not very good. My body feels all weak.'%K%P",
"Akane was looking unhappy, and she didn't have\\nany of her usual vitality.%K%P",
"'You lie still, okay?\\nI brought some rice porridge.\\nCan you eat?'%K%P",
"'Porridge, huh... I'm not very hungry right now...'%K%P",
"'Can you get just a little down?\\nYou'll get better faster if you can\\nget some food in you.'%K%P",
"'Then...can you feed me?'%K%P",
"'Huh? Me?'%K%P",
"'Yeah. I can't do it myself, you know.'%K%P",
"'Yeah, fine. I'll feed you.'%K%P",
"'Really?!'%K%P",
"I sat down next to her and opened the pot.%K%P",
"'Open wide!'%K%P",
"I spooned up some porridge and held it out.\\nAkane's already flushed face got even redder.%K%P",
"'Uh, I mean, that whole feed me thing was just\\nme teasing you, I didn't actually\\nmean it...'%K%P",
"'I know. But would you eat on your own?'%K%P",
"'I... I guess not...'%K%P",
"'So anyway, come on. One bite.'%K%P",
"'Ugh. Fine. Ahhh...'%K%P",
"Akane held back the hair falling over her forehead\\nand opened her mouth.%K%P",
"The enchanting gesture set my heart pounding\\neven as I put the spoon into her mouth.%K%P",
"'*Munch* Mmm... That's good.\\nThis is my first time eating it.'%K%P",
"'People mostly only eat it when they're down\\nwith a cold or something.'%K%P",
"'Figures. Goddesses almost never\\nget sick like this.'%K%P",
"'Akane...'%K%P",
"Goddesses are supernatural entities.%K%P",
"It was unthinkable for them to come down\\nwith human illnesses, which increased my\\nworry over Akane's poor health.%K%P",
"'You'll be okay. I'll take care of you\\nuntil you're all better.'%K%P",
"'Thanks, Sho.\\nHaha... I actually feel relieved!'%K%P",
"Feeling anxious about being sick was the same\\nfor goddesses as for people.%K%P",
"She might be a goddess, but Akane was\\nalso a girl.%K%P",
"'Well...If I do this, I bet you'll feel even\\nmore relieved.'%K%P",
"I suddenly found my empty hand in hers,\\nas if to comfort her anxiety.%K%P",
"'Wah!'%K%P",
"'There, see? You're not alone.'%K%P",
"'...Yeah! Heheh... Thank you.'%K%P",
"'*Gulp*'%K%P",
"Her smile was somehow different.%K%P",
"Looking at Akane's frail, pure smiling face,\\nmy heart started to pound in my chest.%K%P",
"'C-Come on! You'd better finish this off\\nbefore it gets cold.'%K%P",
"'Oh...you are gonna feed me, right?'%K%P",
"'All right, just this once, okay?'%K%P",
"'Yay! Thank you. Aaah!'%K%P",
"'Vroom...'%K%P",
"It was strange...%K%P",
"I suddenly felt embarrassed to be feeding her\\nlike this.%K%P",
"'*Slurp* More please!'%K%P",
"'H-Hey now, not so fast!'%K%P",
"'It got my appetite up.\\nCome on, more more!\\nAaaah!'%K%P",
"I tried to just ignore my feeling.%K%P",
"I decided not to worry about it and \\nfed Akane the rest of the porridge.%K%P",
"'Phew... That was great.'%K%P",
"She finished the whole pot of porridge.%K%P",
"It was rally nice to see her enjoy something\\nI'd made.%K%P",
"'I'm going to go put this stuff away.'%K%P",
"'Oh, wait a minute Sho.'%K%P",
"She took my hand as I was about to leave.%K%P",
"'Is something the matter?'%K%P",
"'Oh, um... Just... Could you stay with me\\nuntil I go to sleep? Please?'%K%P",
"The way she looked up at me from beneath her lashes\\nmade me feel oddly protective.%K%P",
"There was only one way I could answer.%K%P",
"'Of course.'%K%P",
"I said, and clasped her hand.%K%P",
"'I'll stay right here and hold your hand\\nuntil you fall asleep.'%K%P",
"'Thank you...'%K%P",
"Akane then closed her eyes.%K%P",
"Guess there wasn't anything left to talk about,\\nI would just sit and wait for her to drift off.%K%P",
"Her hand was so warm in mine.%K%P",
"'Thanks for everything, Sho.'%K%P",
"I looked up at her barely opened eyes.%K%P",
"'Why, all of a sudden?'%K%P",
"'You've been taking care of me all this time.\\nI wanted to thank you.'%K%P",
"'I just can't let you be. Actually, I was worried I\\nwas butting into your business too much.'%K%P",
"'As if! I've never thought anything like that\\nabout you, Sho.'%K%P",
"'Thank you. No matter what happens, I'll look out\\nfor you, always.'%K%P",
"While I spoke, I squeezed her hand to reassure her.\\nShe returned the pressure.%K%P",
"'Sho... Thanks.'%K%P",
"She slowly closed her eyes again and soon\\nstarted snoring gently.%K%P",
"'Night, Akane.'%K%P",
"I stood up carefully, so as not to wake her,\\nand left her in the room.%K%P",
"'Oh, I hope Akane's all right...'%K%P",
"Inori had been deeply worried after hearing\\nabout Akane's poor health.%K%P",
"Her concern had lasted all day.%K%P",
"The fact that Akane hadn't gotten up since last night\\nwas making her even more worried.%K%P",
"'She'll be fine. Akane'll bounce right back,\\nI know.'%K%P",
"'You say so, but I know you're worried too.'%K%P",
"'Ah...'%K%P",
"I couldn't find a response to Maika's\\naccusing finger.%K%P",
"It was no good.%K%P",
"I had been thinking about Akane since the\\nday before.%K%P",
"She'd been at my side for so long, not having her\\nthere was unsettling.%K%P",
"It was like there was a hole in my heart, like\\nsomething important was missing.%K%P",
"'Well, if you're so worried, go back and\\ncheck on her.'%K%P",
"'Shouldn't we let her rest?'%K%P",
"'Well, breakfast will be ready pretty soon,\\nso you should go ask if she feels like eating.'%K%P",
"'Sure, well, if you think I should.'%K%P",
"'Good morning!'%K%P",
"'Akane!'%K%P",
"Just as I went to go check on her, Akane came\\nbursting into the living room.%K%P",
"'You've recovered enough to get out of bed already?!'%K%P",
"'Yeah, I'm fine! Totally back to normal!'%K%P",
"'Well look at that, she's perfectly healthy!\\nI bet you're ready for breakfast.'%K%P",
"'Sure am! I'm starved!'%K%P",
"'Right. Okay then, the usual?'%K%P",
"'Yes please! Huh? What's wrong, Inori?'%K%P",
"When Akane reached her seat, Inori froze,\\nstaring at her.%K%P",
"'Inori...?'%K%P",
"She had been so worried about Akane until now,\\nI wondered what had happened.%K%P",
"'Say...Akane, do you feel...strange, at all?'%K%P",
"'Strange? Not really, no.\\nI mean, that weird weakness is\\ngone so I feel perfect!'%K%P",
"'Is...that so...'%K%P",
"Saying this, Inori fell deep into thought.%K%P",
"'Hmph. Inori, you're so weird.'%K%P",
"'Did something happen?'%K%P",
"'I think it best we test this right away...'%K%P",
"She raised her head and stared at Akane\\nwith worried eyes.%K%P",
"'Akane, please try to use your Jinriki.'%K%P",
"'Huh? Why?'%K%P",
"'Is that a good idea?'%K%P",
"If Akane used her Jinriki, there would be a blackout.%K%P",
"Inori had been trying to stop Akane from using her\\npower, so I couldn't understand why she was\\nsuddenly doing the opposite.%K%P",
"'It's fine. Indeed, I think it will make everything\\nclear.'%K%P",
"Looking at Inori's face, I could tell this\\nwas no small thing.%K%P",
"'I'll use it, but don't get mad at me if there's\\na blackout.'%K%P",
"Inori nodded solemnly at Akane's words.%K%P",
"'Okay then, here I go.'%K%P",
"Akane spread her arms.%K%P",
"But nothing happened.%K%P",
"'Akane?'%K%P",
"'Ummm... What the--?!'%K%P",
"Akane's voice was loud with shock.%K%P",
"'This, this... Why?! Why can't I use it?'%K%P",
"'You can't use your Jinriki?'%K%P",
"'That's right... No matter how I try, I can't\\ndo anything!'%K%P",
"'Just as I thought.'%K%P",
"'Do you know what's going on?!'%K%P",
"'No, not exactly. The only thing I know is\\nthat Akane's divine powers\\nfeel somehow weak.'%K%P",
"'Her power is weak? Is that normal?'%K%P",
"How could something like that happen?%K%P",
"I'd never heard of it before.%K%P",
"'This is the first time I've ever seen it. I can't\\nimagine what could cause it...'%K%P",
"'Okay, breakfast is ready!\\nHuh? What happened?'%K%P",
"'Oh, well...'%K%P",
"We told Maika about Akane's problem.%K%P",
"'She can't use her power anymore?\\nIs it because she was sick yesterday?'%K%P",
"'That is a possibility, but I think there could be\\na more fundamental problem.'%K%P",
"If Inori as a goddess didn't understand the problem,\\nit was hard to imagine we could be any help.%K%P",
"'Well...what does it matter?'%K%P",
"'What's that supposed to mean?'%K%P",
"'It's not like thinking about it will help...\\nAnyway, I'm hungry.'%K%P",
"Akane put a smile on her face in a show of courage.%K%P",
"Although she was feeling better, we ate our\\nbreakfast amid an oppressive silence.%K%P",
"After breakfast, Akane locked herself in her room.%K%P",
"'Akane...'%K%P",
"I thought of the smiles she made at breakfast.%K%P",
"Although she was the one in trouble, she tried\\nhard to put on a happy face.%K%P",
"It made my chest hurt to think of it.%K%P",
"'We can't just let it be.'%K%P",
"I couldn't stand that sad smile on Akane's face.%K%P",
"Real cheer suited her better.%K%P",
"'I have to get it back.'%K%P",
"I would return Akane's Jinriki, along with her\\nusual smile.%K%P",
"As soon as I decided this, I started thinking\\nof how to do it.%K%P"
