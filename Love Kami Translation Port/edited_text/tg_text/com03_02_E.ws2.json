"I went back to my room to charge my phone and on\\nthe way back, I looked up at the night sky.%K%P",
"'What a nice night.'%K%P",
"The constellation Pegasus filled the autumn sky.%K%P",
"The fall insects played their cool music,\\nannouncing the changing season.%K%P",
"'She can't go home at this hour...'%K%P",
"Akane might be a goddess, but she's still a\\ngirl.%K%P",
"You couldn't say it's entirely safe.%K%P",
"'Maybe she should stay the night.'%K%P",
"Thinking this, I turned my gaze back toward the\\ncourtyard.%K%P",
"'Huh?'%K%P",
"The familiar courtyard hosted an unfamiliar\\nfigure.%K%P",
"'...'%K%P",
"It was a girl, bathed in brilliant moonlight.%K%P",
"Her hair, black as the night, sparkled in the\\nlight of the moon and the stars.%K%P",
"Dressed like a shrine maiden, her slender body\\nand  elegant face were like a painting.%K%P",
"'You're a goddess, aren't you...?'%K%P",
"I could tell at a glance.%K%P",
"This girl was different from Akane, she had an\\nentrancing divine beauty that pulled me in.%K%P",
"She was much more like the goddesses I'd seen on\\nTV.%K%P",
"Hearing my murmur, the girl turned her eyes to\\nme.%K%P",
"'...Oh? Might you be Sho Narumi?'%K%P",
"Her voice fell on my ears like the pure ringing\\nof a bell.%K%P",
"'Um... Uh, yes, yes I am. May I ask how you know\\nmy name?'%K%P",
"'I do apologize. I am the local earth goddess of\\nKannagi, Inori Kamiki.'%K%P",
"'Thank you for your kind introduction.'%K%P",
"The local earth goddess... That must mean she's\\nsomeone very important.%K%P",
"'But wait... The local earth goddess?! What is\\nan earth goddess doing here?!'%K%P",
"'I have a small errand. I have special\\npermission from my boss, so pardon the\\nintrusion.'%K%P",
"She covered her mouth and gave a small laugh.\\nThe gesture seemed to suit her.%K%P",
"She was worlds apart from a certain collapsing\\ngoddess...%K%P",
"'An errand, was it?'%K%P",
"I had a feeling that I knew what this was\\nabout...%K%P",
"I had never even dreamed that a goddess might\\ncome to Tsubaki Apartments.%K%P",
"But tonight, a certain guest was visiting.%K%P",
"'I have business with Akane Tsubaki, whom I know\\nto be here tonight.'%K%P",
"Yep, I was right.%K%P",
"'Was it wrong of me to bring her here?'%K%P",
"'Oh no, but I'm sure she has been a burden.\\nAkane tends to wander off when no one is\\nlooking.'%K%P",
"The way she put a hand on her cheek and sighed\\nwas the essence of humility.%K%P",
"'I don't think she's been a burden.'%K%P",
"'Is that so? I'm glad to hear that.'%K%P",
"Inori was so gentle. She was very easy to talk\\nto, but in a different way from Akane.%K%P",
"'Oh, do pardon my going on. Would you please\\nshow me the way to Akane?'%K%P",
"'Of course. Right this way.'%K%P",
"I led Inori inside to find Akane.%K%P",
"'My name is Inori Kamiki. It's a pleasure to\\nmeet you.'%K%P",
"Inori bowed deeply to Maika.%K%P",
"'Uh... My name is Maika Kunugi. The pleasure is\\nmine. Sho? Why is there another goddess here?'%K%P",
"'She wants to talk to Akane, apparently.'%K%P",
"'Why Akane?'%K%P",
"She glanced at Akane.%K%P",
"Akane had turned away, her shoulders slumped as\\nif her earlier cheer had never been.%K%P",
"Inori drew near to her.%K%P",
"'Akane, I've been looking for you.'%K%P",
"'...You didn't need to.'%K%P",
"'You know that's not true. You're my\\nresponsibility.'%K%P",
"'That's not my fault, I never asked you to!'%K%P",
"'As you have said many times. Don't you know\\nyou're causing people trouble?'%K%P",
"'Whatever! I'm just doing what I want! I don't\\nhave to explain every little thing to you. Go\\non, go away!'%K%P",
"Inori's expression hardened at Akane's 'shoo'\\ngesture.%K%P",
"Huh?%K%P",
"One would think goddesses would be able to talk\\npeacefully, but it looked like a storm was\\nbrewing  here...%K%P",
"'A-Akane. I'm only trying to help you with your\\nrehabilitation!'%K%P",
"'If you really want to help me, then just let me\\nbe! What, are you that bored?'%K%P",
"'B-Bored? This is my responsibility! This is no\\ngame for me!'%K%P",
"'Oh, I see... You're so pathetic they didn't\\nwant to give you a real job.'%K%P",
"'Wrong! Your rehab never seems to end so I can't\\ndo anything else! Once you're better, I can get\\non with important patron goddess work!'%K%P",
"It was like a teacher arguing with a juvenile\\ndelinquent...%K%P",
"I'd thought that goddesses were some mystical,\\nelegant beings, different from humans.%K%P",
"But judging from the back-and-forth happening\\nright here, goddesses were no different from\\nhumans.%K%P",
"'Just shut up already! Quit going on about\\n'rehab, rehab,' like it's the only word you\\nknow!'%K%P",
"'You reeeally are a worthless pain-in-the-butt\\ngoddess!'%K%P",
"Akane was now the angry one.%K%P",
"'Ugh, a blackout now?!'%K%P",
"As if responding to Akane's anger, the lights\\nwent off and sent the room into darkness.%K%P",
"If Akane went off in this darkness, who knows\\nwhat might happen.%K%P",
"I had to stop this somehow.%K%P",
"Suddenly, I heard the rustling of cloth and a\\nfigure leapt up from the dark.%K%P",
"'Huh? You want a piece of me?! You'd rather me\\nbow and scrape for you!'%K%P",
"Once my eyes were used to the dark, I could see\\nInori glaring at Akane.%K%P",
"Huh, who was this?%K%P",
"Where did that meek, gentle flower of Japanese\\nbeauty go?%K%P",
"I might have been imagining it, but it sounded\\nlike rain had started to pour down outside.%K%P",
"'Pshaw! Like I'd ever listen to a dirt goddess\\nlike you!'%K%P",
"'Dirt goddess?! Oh, it is ON now!'%K%P",
"'Hah, you're just mad because it's true, you're\\nsuch a little brat!'%K%P",
"'Oh, I'm a little brat?! You're the one who\\nthrows a tantrum every time you don't get your\\nway!'%K%P",
"'Shove it, little Miss Conformity!'%K%P",
"'C-Conformity?! I'm going to get you\\nrehabilitated no matter what!'%K%P",
"'Psh! Bring it on, if you think you can handle\\nme!'%K%P",
"They were starting to sound like children.%K%P",
"I glimpsed to the side, and saw Maika staring\\ndumbfounded at the goddess fight.%K%P",
"For the time being, if we didn't get things\\nsettled down, then the discussion would go\\nnowhere.%K%P",
"'Um, okay you two... All this shouting at night\\nis--'%K%P",
"'Look at you, an unemployed freeloading goddess\\ntalking like she's queen of the world!'%K%P",
"'Oh please! I'm free, I don't need to work!'%K%P",
"'Exactly, that's what the humans call a\\nFREELOADER!'%K%P",
"It was no good. Neither of them would listen to\\nme.%K%P",
"I might have to get rough, but it looked like it\\nwouldn't stop until I got Akane restrained.%K%P",
"'Now listen up! You two have got to stop this\\nfighting, all-- Wah!'%K%P",
"Unable to see in the dark room, I tripped over a\\nchair.%K%P",
"'Eeek!'%K%P",
"'Wh-What?! Sho, are you okay?'%K%P",
"'I'm fine, I just ran into something.'%K%P",
"I had tripped, but I saved myself from falling\\nby grabbing onto something.%K%P",
"Something soft, and that smelled good...%K%P",
"'Um... Mmm...'%K%P",
"I could hear a captivating voice very nearby,\\nand straining my eyes in the dark I made out\\nInori's back...%K%P",
"So... So this softness under my hands...%K%P",
"'Oh... Sho...! Please, don't squeeze so hard...'%K%P",
"'What?! Sho! What are you doing?!'%K%P",
"'No, wait! It was an accident!'%K%P",
"'Uhh... Sho, your fingers are moving again...'%K%P",
"'Get away from her right this instant, you\\nidiot!'%K%P",
"'I-I'm so sorry!'%K%P",
"I should have gotten away from her like Maika\\ndemanded.%K%P",
"But it seemed so wrong to release the blissful\\nsoftness that my hands were enjoying.%K%P",
"'Oh, brave boy Sho! Go get her! But hey, if\\nyou're going to do it, really grab on! Like\\nthis!'%K%P",
"'Now hold on! What are you doing, Akane?!'%K%P",
"'Ah! Th-That tickles!'%K%P",
"'This is a riot to watch! And Sho is a boy,\\nafter all, I bet he's enjoying it!'%K%P",
"And just as Akane said, I would have loved\\nnothing more than to really squeeze.%K%P",
"It was such a rare opportunity, I really wanted\\nto savor the moment.%K%P",
"'Sho! Hey! You let go of her right now! Get\\naway!'%K%P",
"'Ouch!'%K%P",
"Just as reason and desire battled it out in my\\nbrain, Maika's thump on my head helped reason\\nwin... But it was close.%K%P"
