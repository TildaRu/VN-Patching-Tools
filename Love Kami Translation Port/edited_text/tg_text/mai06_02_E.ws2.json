"'Are you really going to give her this?'%K%P",
"'Of course. If we follow this plan we'll be\\nfinished in no time!'%K%P",
"Maika winked, full of confidence. I couldn't say\\nI shared her enthusiasm for the schedule she'd\\ncreated.%K%P",
"Even after reducing it to the bare minimum, it\\nwould still cut Akane's free time in half.%K%P",
"Throwing this at her out of nowhere might not\\nend well.%K%P",
"'Akane, do you have a minute?'%K%P",
"'Huh? What is it.'%K%P",
"'Here.'%K%P",
"Akane was laying down, as usual, but Maika\\nstrode forward and handed her the stack of\\npapers she'd just written up.%K%P",
"'What's this?'%K%P",
"'It's your new rehabilitation schedule. I know\\nit looks like a lot, but I'll be here with you\\nevery step of the way.'%K%P",
"'Oh...'%K%P",
"Akane glanced over the schedule. She didn't look\\nimpressed.%K%P",
"Since Maika had started 'helping', Akane had\\ngone along with her suggestions without\\ncomplaining.%K%P",
"But now...%K%P",
"'Let's go, Akane. We've got cleaning to attend\\nto.'%K%P",
"'Aw, but so much has happened lately, can't I at\\nleast take today off?'%K%P",
"'Maika, one day won't hurt, right? Akane has\\nbeen working hard.'%K%P",
"'No deal. I want to help reform Akane and save\\nTsubaki ASAP. Even one day can make all the\\ndifference.'%K%P",
"Maika tried to hurry Akane into getting up, but\\nthe goddess didn't move.%K%P",
"'Akane? Come on, hurry up and--'%K%P",
"'No.'%K%P",
"'Huh?'%K%P",
"'I said no. I don't wanna.'%K%P",
"'C-Come on, Akane. If we don't properly\\nrehabilitate you, Tsubaki will--'%K%P",
"'I don't care! Sho does his best for my sake, so\\nI don't mind trying hard for him.'%K%P",
"'But all you care about is yourself. It's no fun\\nhere anymore! If this is how you want this house\\nto be, I won't lift a finger to save it!'%K%P",
"'What?! You're just going to let it disappear?!'%K%P",
"'Yeah, why not? I don't care about it anymore.'%K%P",
"'Akane...you're really starting to cross the\\nline!'%K%P",
"'Hey now, you two, let's all keep cool--'%K%P",
"'You stay out of this, Sho!'%K%P",
"'I'm doing everything I can for this place and\\nfor you, Akane. Take back what you said!'%K%P",
"'No, it's the truth. I'll feel bad for you two\\nif you lose this place, but that doesn't mean\\nyou can do whatever you want to me.'%K%P",
"'How can you say that? You're supposed to be\\nTsubaki's household goddess!'%K%P",
"'Fine, I'll quit! Then it won't matter if I do\\nget demoted to being a spirit!'%K%P",
"'Whoa! Hey, Akane!'%K%P",
"Akane got up and left, ignoring us when we tried\\nto call her back.%K%P",
"'Maika, I think you went too far.'%K%P",
"'But I... I'm sorry. I need to go cool my head a\\nlittle.'%K%P",
"Her voice was trembling as she walked away and\\nleft me alone in the living room.%K%P",
"After their fight, Akane and Maika made a point\\nof avoiding or ignoring each other.%K%P",
"Maika was so on edge I was afraid to say\\nanything.%K%P",
"'What am I supposed to do?'%K%P",
"'Sho.'%K%P",
"'Inori?'%K%P",
"I was in my room trying to think of a solution\\nwhen Inori came to visit.%K%P",
"'There's something I need to talk to you about.\\nMay I come in?'%K%P",
"'Of course.'%K%P",
"'Thank you.'%K%P",
"'Feel free to sit wherever.'%K%P",
"She sat down facing me, her posture stiff and\\nformal.%K%P",
"'You said you needed to talk?'%K%P",
"'Akane and Maika both seem irritated. Did\\nsomething happen between them?'%K%P",
"Well, she was bound to ask.%K%P",
"I told Inori all about the fight between Akane\\nand Maika.%K%P",
"'I see. That explains their behavior.'%K%P",
"'I feel responsible. If I'd seen this coming a\\nlittle sooner...'%K%P",
"'It's not your fault. But this might pose quite\\na serious problem.'%K%P",
"'Yeah, Akane's going to lose interest in her\\nrehabilitation again.'%K%P",
"'Well, that's part of it, yes. But it could be\\neven worse if Akane really does resign her\\nposition as household goddess.'%K%P",
"'What would be so bad about that?'%K%P",
"'Just as I have a duty to watch over Kannagi\\nTown, Akane's role is to protect Tsubaki\\nApartments from misfortune and disaster.'%K%P",
"'These duties are important for us goddesses. It\\ndidn't seem relevant before, but allow me to\\nmake something clear.'%K%P",
"'If Akane really does unceremoniously quit being\\na household goddess, she will definitely be\\ndemoted to spirit status.'%K%P",
"'What? Just from quitting her job?'%K%P",
"'I do not believe our boss would show mercy to a\\ngoddess that has abandoned her duties.'%K%P",
"'Tsubaki is a very old building. The reason it's\\nsurvived so long is because of its household\\ngoddess's protection, meager though it may be.'%K%P",
"'Even if it avoids demolition, without that\\ndivine protection it will age rapidly and may\\neven fall apart on its own.'%K%P",
"I couldn't let that happen.%K%P",
"I had no idea Akane's power over this place was\\nso important.%K%P",
"On the other hand...%K%P",
"'Can she really quit just like that, though?'%K%P",
"'Normally, no. But Akane is an Aragami. Her\\npower tends to respond directly to her desires.'%K%P",
"'If she truly wishes to cease being a household\\ngoddess, it may very well become so.'%K%P",
"Inori stopped for breath while I tried to take\\nall of it in.%K%P",
"This was more serious than I thought.%K%P",
"'Thank you for telling me.'%K%P",
"'I only did what I had to. I love living here at\\nTsubaki Apartments with all of you so much.'%K%P",
"'So I really don't want it to end like this.'%K%P",
"'Me too. I won't let all our efforts go to\\nwaste.'%K%P",
"'In that case, I will leave the rest to you.'%K%P",
"'Sure. I'll find a way to keep everyone happy.'%K%P",
"I was determined to do whatever it would take.%K%P"
