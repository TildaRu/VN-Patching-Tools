"'Are you doing something Maika?'%K%P",
"I started a conversation with Maika.%K%P",
"Since I'd been constantly attending to Akane\\nlately, it was about time I checked in with\\nMaika.%K%P",
"'Nothing special. Just chores.'%K%P",
"'Need any help?'%K%P",
"'I'm fine. You've been working with Akane and\\nInori all this time. I think you should get some\\nrest.'%K%P",
"'But you just came back from school too.'%K%P",
"'Don't worry about me. Look, it seems like\\nthey're going out, so maybe you should join\\nthem.'%K%P",
"'Hey, don't push me!'%K%P",
"I was kicked out of the living room like a stray\\ncat and ended up just being lazy in my room.%K%P",
"'I can't just be in my room alone.'%K%P",
"It just didn't feel right for me to rest in my\\nroom while Maika did all the chores.%K%P",
"But I knew that my childhood friend would never\\nallow me to help her.%K%P",
"'Maybe I should make some tea for her.'%K%P",
"A harmless gesture.%K%P",
"'Hmm?'%K%P",
"I paused when I heard breathing... The kind of\\nbreathing you'd make when asleep.%K%P",
"'*Zzz* Hmnum...'%K%P",
"'Maika?'%K%P",
"When I looked around, I found Maika sitting,\\nleaning against a big garden tree in the corner\\nof the courtyard.%K%P",
"'Is she asleep? I've never seen her take a nap\\nlike this.'%K%P",
"'Mm...mm...'%K%P",
"'She's sound asleep.'%K%P",
"Since she's usually the one on top of things, it\\nwas refreshing to see her looking child-like and\\ninnocent like this.%K%P",
"It caught me off guard catching my long-time\\nchildhood friend, who's just as cute as Akane\\nand Inori, in such a vulnerable state.%K%P",
"'I should probably let her sleep.'%K%P",
"I leaned over to watch Maika's face as she\\nslept.%K%P",
"'This is making me feel nostalgic.'%K%P",
"I looked around the courtyard while I was still\\nleaned over.%K%P",
"'We used to play here a lot.'%K%P",
"When we were kids, this tiny courtyard felt a\\nlot bigger.%K%P",
"I can recall many times when we would tire\\nourselves out playing all day and end up passing\\nout.%K%P",
"'Mmm...'%K%P",
"As I was remembering our days as kids, Maika\\nslowly opened her eyes.%K%P",
"'Sorry, did I wake you?'%K%P",
"'Oh... Sho-chan...?'%K%P",
"'When was the last time you called me Sho-chan?'%K%P",
"As kids, we were Sho-chan and Mai-chan. But\\nlater, we naturally grew out of it.%K%P",
"It was cute for us to do as kids.%K%P",
"'Th-That was a dream, right? But, if it\\nwere...eheheh... Your hand...'%K%P",
"'Maika?'%K%P",
"Still half asleep, Maika tightly grasped my\\nhand.%K%P",
"Our hands overlapped innocently, without any\\nsense of distinction as man and woman.%K%P",
"This was exactly like when we played in the\\ncourtyard as kids.%K%P",
"'Heheh... I like being like this.'%K%P",
"'Come to think of it, we used to hold hands a\\nlot.'%K%P",
"'Yeah... Sho-chan, do you know that I love you?'%K%P",
"'Yeah, I love you too Maika.'%K%P",
"She's my dear childhood friend, after all.%K%P",
"'Heh... Oh? Huh?'%K%P",
"When Maika realized her fingers were entwined,\\nher half-asleep vision started getting clearer.%K%P",
"'What? This...is real? Was that not just a\\ndream?'%K%P",
"'Oh, well... Good morning Mai-chan.'%K%P",
"'...'%K%P",
"I unintentionally called Maika by her childhood\\nname which made her turn bright red.%K%P",
"'Maika? Hey, Maika.'%K%P",
"'Oh, uhhh, d-did you see or hear anything?'%K%P",
"'Huh? Well, yeah.'%K%P",
"Since there was no point in lying, I answered\\nhonestly.%K%P",
"'Heh, heheh, so you saw. You saw me asleep and\\nsleep-talk...'%K%P",
"'Ahah, haha, ahahahahaha...'%K%P",
"'Whaaaaaat?!?! You gotta be kidding meeeee!'%K%P",
"'Why?! Why do you have to catch me at my most\\nembarrassing moments?!'%K%P",
"'Whoa!'%K%P",
"Maika stood up with force while she raised her\\nvoice.%K%P",
"'F-Forget it! Okay? Just forget everything you\\nsaw just now. All of it. Okay?!'%K%P",
"'Sorry about all that, but you looked cute\\nsleeping and it made me happy when you called me\\nSho-chan.'%K%P",
"'Ack... please forget it... You meanie...'%K%P",
"Maika's voice shook and her face blushed with\\nshame, all which resembled her as a timid child.%K%P",
"'I'm really sorry. I'm gonna leave since I'm\\ndisturbing you.'%K%P",
"'Oh...'%K%P",
"When I got up, Maika grabbed and pulled on my\\nshirt.%K%P",
"It must've been unintentional because she looked\\nsurprised herself.%K%P",
"'U-Um... I never said that you were disturbing\\nme.'%K%P",
"'Are you sure?'%K%P",
"'Y-Yeah. B-By the way, do you remember? We used\\nto play under this tree all the time.'%K%P",
"'Of course I do. We played together all the\\ntime. We both carved on the tree to compare our\\nheights.'%K%P",
"'Yeah, you're right. It was right over here.'%K%P",
"We went over to the other side of the tree and\\nfound the rough lines we'd carved as kids.%K%P",
"We marked our heights with rocks we found and\\ncompeted many times over our height.%K%P",
"'There they are. See, how nostalgic. You would\\nalways say that you were taller than me no\\nmatter what.'%K%P",
"'Ha, I didn't want a girl to beat me in height.'%K%P",
"'Eheh. But I was competitive with you too. Oh\\nyeah, do you remember when you fell from this\\ntree when you tried to climb it?'%K%P",
"'That hurt a lot. I didn't think the branches\\nwould break so easily.'%K%P",
"When I slammed on the ground, I remember being\\nsurprised about not breaking a bone.%K%P",
"'You cried quite a bit.'%K%P",
"'I know. And you started crying with me too. The\\nwhole thing was a disaster.'%K%P",
"'Of course I cried. After a loud crack, you fell\\nfrom above. Seeing you in so much pain, I\\nthought you were going to die.'%K%P",
"Yup, not the smartest thing I'd done.%K%P",
"After that, we were scolded by Maika's parents\\nand neighbors who rushed over when they heard\\nour cries.%K%P",
"But I remember being more bitter about being\\nbanned from playing in the courtyard than being\\nscolded.%K%P",
"'Why did you want to climb the tree all of a\\nsudden? You were never really the adventurous\\ntype, even as a kid.'%K%P",
"'Uhh... Are you really making me answer that?'%K%P",
"'Yup. You saw me asleep and heard me sleep-talk\\nearlier. We'll get even with this.'%K%P",
"'But, you told me to forget about it.'%K%P",
"'You saw it, right?'%K%P",
"'Fine.'%K%P",
"Oh well. It's embarrassing for both of us.%K%P",
"'I guess I was still young and reckless at the\\ntime.'%K%P",
"'Yeah, so?'%K%P",
"'Well, so, I wanted to show off. I wanted to\\nprove myself to you.'%K%P",
"'Pfff, haha. Seriously?'%K%P",
"'D-Don't laugh. I was serious at the time.'%K%P",
"Even as a kid, it was pretty stupid of me to\\nshow off by climbing that tree.%K%P",
"'Heh, sorry, sorry. But, you climbed a tree to\\nshow off.'%K%P",
"'I was really competitive as a kid. A-Anyway,\\nthat's the reason I tried climbing it.'%K%P",
"'I see... So, what was the most memorable thing\\nfor you, Sho?'%K%P",
"'Most memorable thing...?'%K%P",
"What could that be?%K%P",
"I struggled to go through my memories and\\nremembered one thing.%K%P",
"'I know, it has nothing to do with the\\ncourtyard, but I remember that horror TV show.'%K%P",
"'Horror TV show?'%K%P",
"'Oh? You don't remember?'%K%P",
"Even when I look back now, I still feel that it\\nmade a huge impression on me.%K%P",
"'Hmm, sorry, can't remember. What about it?'%K%P",
"'We watched a horror show at night together and\\nit was way too scary. You don't remember being\\nscared?'%K%P",
"'There was a time when you would call me every\\ntime you needed to go to the bathroom.'%K%P",
"'What...?'%K%P",
"'You would call me every other minute and kept\\nthe door open just in case something happened so\\nyou could escape.'%K%P",
"'Ahhh!'%K%P",
"Maika's faced turned bright red, much like\\nearlier when I caught her asleep, and she sat\\ndown, perplexed.%K%P",
"'A-Augh... Th-This is the worst. I had forgotten\\nabout it and now it's all coming back to me...'%K%P",
"'I'm...sorry.'%K%P",
"I didn't realize it was going to be such a\\nsensitive topic for her.%K%P",
"'You need to forget about it again! Including\\nthe stuff from today! Don't ever remember them,\\nor mention them again!'%K%P",
"'Y-Yeah. I'll forget it.'%K%P",
"'Promise? Ugh... What was wrong with me back\\nthen?'%K%P",
"'It's like with me climbing the tree. We all do\\nirrational things as kids.'%K%P",
"'Even then, it's still embarrassing... I'm\\nexhausted. I'll be in the living room.'%K%P",
"'I'll go back with you. And as an apology, let\\nme serve you some tea.'%K%P",
"'I'll accept it only if the tea's really good.'%K%P",
"'I'll do the best I can.'%K%P",
"While we were having tea in the living room, we\\nheard hurried footsteps coming from the\\nentrance.%K%P",
"'Sho, I'm back!'%K%P",
"'Welcome home, Akane.'%K%P",
"'Maika too, I'm back!'%K%P",
"'Yes. Welcome home, Akane.'%K%P",
"'Phew, it's been a while since I walked around\\nthat much.'%K%P",
"'All right. I'll start preparing dinner now, so\\njust wait a little longer.'%K%P",
"'Thanks. I'm starved!'%K%P",
"Akane sat down on a chair and lay herself on the\\ntable, exhausted.%K%P",
"'Where were you today?'%K%P",
"'Oh, the shopping streets nearby, since I\\nhaven't shown my face in a while.'%K%P",
"'Still as popular as ever I assume.'%K%P",
"'Yup. Everyone's so nice there.'%K%P",
"All thanks to Akane's sociable personality.%K%P",
"Her personality attracts so many people.%K%P",
"'Come to think of it, Inori's not back yet.\\nAkane, do you have any idea where she went?'%K%P",
"'I don't know where she's been.'%K%P",
"'But I bumped into her on the way back, so we\\nraced home.'%K%P",
"'Raced? You mean, you ran all the way home?'%K%P",
"'Yup, but I didn't run that much. Probably about\\n100 meters.'%K%P",
"'100 meters...'%K%P",
"Even if that distance was a piece of cake for\\nAkane, for someone like Inori who's not that\\ngood at physical activities...%K%P",
"'*Huff* Augh... I-I'm back...'%K%P",
"I knew it.%K%P",
"'Are you okay, Inori?'%K%P",
"'Bwahaha, Inori, you really don't have any\\nstamina.'%K%P",
"'Haa, haa, I-I'm done... I can't take another\\nstep...'%K%P",
"'Are you okay? Here's some water.'%K%P",
"Maika returned from the kitchen and handed Inori\\na glass of water.%K%P",
"'*Gulp gulp* Phew... I'm alive again. Thank you\\nvery much, Maika.'%K%P",
"'Don't worry about it. I'm gonna go back to\\nfinish making dinner.'%K%P",
"Maika stood up and headed to the kitchen. But,\\nthen she turned back around.%K%P",
"'Hey, Sho.'%K%P",
"'Yeah?'%K%P",
"'It was nice when it was just us two here at\\nTsubaki, but...it's actually kinda nice when\\nit's lively like this too.'%K%P",
"'Ain't that the truth.'%K%P",
"Thus, another turbulent day had passed.%K%P"
