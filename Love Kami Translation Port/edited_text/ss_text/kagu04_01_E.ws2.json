  "'I'm here!'%K%P",
  "'Come on in.'%K%P",
  "Ready for practice,\\nKagura came bounding into the shop.%K%P",
  "She looked as though she'd completely\\nrecovered from yesterday's incident.%K%P",
  "'Okay, so for today I was thinking we should\\nput together a new music video.'%K%P",
  "'It'd be a good way of showcasing your charms,\\ndon't you think?'%K%P",
  "'Oh, about that.\\nI've decided to quit.'%K%P",
  "'Hmm? Quit what?'%K%P",
  "'The last round of the auditions, duh.'%K%P",
  "'So there's no need for a new video.'%K%P",
  "'Oh, I see. In that case... Wait, what?'%K%P",
  "'Geez, aren't you listening?\\nI'm pulling out of the contest, okay?'%K%P",
  "Kagura laughed casually as she\\ndropped the bomb.%K%P",
  "As for me, I could barely comprehend\\nwhat was going on, and had to ask again.%K%P",
  "'Wh-What are you talking about?\\nThis is a joke, right?'%K%P",
  "'I'm serious.\\nI never had a chance anyway.'%K%P",
  "'What? Why would you...'%K%P",
  "The words caught in my throat as the\\nrealization hit me.%K%P",
  "'Is this because of what you read online yesterday?'%K%P",
  "'That's part of it, I guess.\\nAfter I went home, I sat down and thought about it.'%K%P",
  "'And I realized the reason that I'd made it this far\\nwas because of Shuri.%K%P",
  "'I told you, it's not like that at all!'%K%P",
  "'And what about your promise with Shuri?\\nThat you'd take on the final round together.'%K%P",
  "'Haha, there's no way!\\nI'll never be as good as her.'%K%P",
  "'Don't say that,\\nyou're a match for Shuri any day.'%K%P",
  "Even if you think that's the case,\\nnot everyone else sees me that way.%K%P",
  "'You can't let criticism like that get to you.\\nIt's not like you to give up so easily.'%K%P",
  "'...That's not all.'%K%P",
  "'Huh?'%K%P",
  "'I said that's not all!'%K%P",
  "Kagura shouted,\\nnearly biting my head off in the process.%K%P",
  "'There's no way I could get through the final round,\\nI'm just an add-on for Shuri, remember?'%K%P",
  "'Now that I know I've got no chance of winning,\\nI can stop pushing myself so hard.'%K%P",
  "'Are you really serious about this?'%K%P",
  "'Yeah, I've never really liked\\ncompeting against or trying to beat people.'%K%P",
  "'I only started out trying to join L☆SEVEN\\nbecause it kinda looked like fun...'%K%P",
  "'I was never really serious about joining them\\nthe way Shuri is...'%K%P",
  "'You're lying.'%K%P",
  "'No, it's the truth.'%K%P",
  "I'll be happy just doing what I used to do,\\ndancing on stage at the cafe,\\nand being an idol on the net.%K%P",
  "I shook my head.\\nI just couldn't accept this.%K%P",
  "'It's not. You know it's not.'%K%P",
  "'You wanted to join L☆SEVEN\\njust as much as Shuri does, maybe even more.'%K%P",
  "'How would you know?'%K%P",
  "'Because I've been right here beside you\\nthe whole time.'%K%P",
  "'...!'%K%P",
  "I'd spent so long watching Kagura train\\nthat I could tell.%K%P",
  "That she was always striving forward,\\nworking her hardest to be worthy of L☆SEVEN...%K%P",
  "'You just don't get it...\\nYou don't understand how I feel at all!'%K%P",
  "'Huh? Hey, Kagura!'%K%P",
  "Kagura abruptly turned her back to me,\\nand ran right out the door.%K%P",
  "Without stopping to think, I dashed after her.%K%P",
  "'Where could she have run off to? Damn...'%K%P",
  "I managed to chase her into the center of town,\\nbut lost sight of her after that.%K%P",
  "With so many people around,\\nthere was no way I would find her.%K%P",
  "'I guess I can try calling her...'%K%P",
  "She probably wouldn't answer,\\nbut I called Kagura's cell just in case.%K%P",
  "'...She's not picking up.'%K%P",
  "Of course she wasn't,\\nwhat had I expected?%K%P",
  "Realizing that it was no use,\\nI decided to hang up.%K%P",
  "'What next...'%K%P",
  "Obviously,\\nI couldn't just leave her like this.%K%P",
  "Kagura and I had worked so hard together,\\nwe were like partners.%K%P",
  "'I can't afford to sit around wasting time'%K%P",
  "I had to find Kagura and fast.\\nBut I couldn't just run around searching randomly.%K%P",
  "'Think... Where would she go...'%K%P",
  "Off the top of my head, I could only think of\\nthe cafe where she worked or my family's store.%K%P",
  "Obviously, she wouldn't be in either of those places\\nat a time like this.%K%P",
  "'That only leaves one other option.'%K%P",
  "I decided to take action.\\nThere was somewhere else Kagura might be.%K%P",
  "In case of emergencies, she had given me\\nher home address.%K%P",
  "'Here I am...'%K%P",
  "It was a pretty long walk from Akiba,\\nbut I eventually arrived at Kagura's apartment.%K%P",
  "A totally normal-looking building,\\nno one would have ever guessed a goddess lived there.%K%P",
  "But this was the place,\\nassuming she'd given me the right address.%K%P",
  "'Now I just have to find her apartment.'%K%P",
  "Finding myself outside Kagura's door,\\nI took a deep breath.%K%P",
  "I knocked hard,\\nmaking sure she'd definitely hear if she was inside.%K%P",
  "'Kagura, are you there? It's me, Yamato.'%K%P",
  "I yelled through the door but there was no reply.\\nI doubt she was in any mood to talk to me, though.%K%P",
  "But then an idea came to me,\\nI called her cell.%K%P",
  "'Ack!'%K%P",
  "Through the door I heard the sound of not only\\nKagura's ringtone, but also a surprised cry.%K%P",
  "I'd been right. It was Kagura's voice.%K%P",
  "There was the sound of someone moving around,\\nthen the ringtone stopped.%K%P",
  "'Kagura, you're in there, right?'%K%P",
  "'...'%K%P",
  "'Don't try to pretend you're not.\\nI heard your voice just now.'%K%P",
  "'...'%K%P",
  "'Look, I know you're there.\\nPlease answer me.'%K%P",
  "'Me-Meooow...'%K%P",
  "'That's not fooling anyone.'%K%P",
  "That was Kagura's voice,\\nno doubt about it.%K%P",
  "She didn't really think I'd\\nfall for that, did she?%K%P",
  "'Urgh, why did you come here, anyway?'%K%P",
  "'I want to talk to you. Why else would I be here?'%K%P",
  "'I've got nothing to say to you,\\nnothing at all.'%K%P",
  "'Then just listen, okay?'%K%P",
  "'You know, I can't just accept that\\nyou'd give up on the audition just like that.'%K%P",
  "'Why not? It's got nothing to do with you!'%K%P",
  "'This is my problem,\\njust leave me alone.'%K%P",
  "'I can't do that, either.\\nIt's not only your problem, you know.'%K%P",
  "There was still a door between us,\\nbut I responded firmly.%K%P",
  "'You're the one who asked me\\nto help you out, after all.'%K%P",
  "'It's not really fair to rope me into this then say\\nit's got nothing to do with me, right?'%K%P",
  "'Hmm... But that...'%K%P",
  "'Don't get me wrong.\\nI didn't come here to give you a guilt trip.'%K%P",
  "'It's just...\\nI don't want you to give up this easily.'%K%P",
  "'...Why not?'%K%P",
  "When I first teamed up with Kagura and Shuri,\\nI was mainly just going with the flow.%K%P",
  "But after spending so much time together,\\na new ambition was taking root in my heart.%K%P",
  "She was always so positive and honest.\\nI just wanted to help make her dreams come true...%K%P",
  "At some point, helping Kagura\\nhad become my heart's fondest desire.%K%P",
  "'Because you're more qualified to be an idol\\nthan anyone else.'%K%P",
  "'...Why do you think that?'%K%P",
  "'I don't think, I know it. There's no way I couldn't\\nafter working with you for so long.'%K%P",
  "I'd said the same thing before,\\nand I still meant it.%K%P",
  "Kagura had the potential\\nto become a superstar, and I knew it.%K%P",
  "She had what the others needed,\\nthat amazing raw talent to become an idol.%K%P",
  "'I'll say it loud and proud, as many times as it\\ntakes to get through to you.'%K%P",
  "'You're more qualified to be an idol\\nthan anyone I know, Kagura.'%K%P",
  "'...'%K%P",
  "'There's one other thing I want you to remember.\\nYou're not alone in this.'%K%P",
  "'For what it's worth, I'll always be here for you\\nif you need me.'%K%P",
  "I packed all the passion I had into those words.%K%P",
  "I imagined how Kagura looked when she was dancing,\\nso full of joy and life.%K%P",
  "I wished more people could see her dance like that.\\nI wanted her to realize...%K%P",
  "Because I...%K%P",
  "'...Why would you go this far\\njust to help me?'%K%P",
  "'Because I like you.'%K%P",
  "'Huh...'%K%P",
  "'Not just as an idol or a goddess,\\nbut as a girl...'%K%P",
  "'I like you, Kagura.'%K%P",
  "Well, the cat was out of the bag now.%K%P",
  "Those feelings had come welling up from the depths\\nof my heart. Even if she hadn't been a goddess,\\nI knew Kagura would know how I felt.%K%P",
  "'...'%K%P",
  "In silence, I waited for some kind of response.%K%P",
  "I was prepared to stand there in front of her door\\nuntil she was ready to speak to me again.%K%P",
  "'Oh...'%K%P",
  "The door of her apartment slowly opened\\nright before my eyes.%K%P",
  "And finally,\\nKagura showed her face.%K%P",
  "'Kagura...!'%K%P",
  "'Hehe...'%K%P",
  "She stepped out of her room,\\ngiggling bashfully as she looked at me.%K%P",
  "'Phew.\\nI was getting ready to wait out here all night.'%K%P",
  "'Sorry, Yamato. I...'%K%P",
  "'It's okay. More importantly,\\nabout the audition...\\nDo you still want to quit?' %K%P",
  "'No, I'm over that now.'%K%P",
  "'So you mean...?'%K%P",
  "'Yeah. I'll try seeing this through to the end.'%K%P",
  "'Are you sure?'%K%P",
  "'How could I give up after that stirring speech?\\nI wouldn't be worthy of being a goddess\\nif I gave up now'%K%P",
  "Kagura shot me a smile.%K%P",
  "It was the same bright, cheery smile I'd grown\\nto know and love.%K%P",
  "'Good, I had a feeling\\nyou'd feel that way.'%K%P",
  "'Hehe! Thanks, Yamato.'%K%P",
  "'I feel totally recharged now,\\nthanks to you.'%K%P",
  "'I must be a pretty pathetic goddess\\nto need cheering up.'%K%P",
  "'Everyone needs someone to turn to now and then.\\nEven goddesses.'%K%P",
  "'We all go through hard times, sad times.\\nThere's nothing wrong with supporting each other.'%K%P",
  "'Yamato... Yeah, you're right.\\nHehehe. Thanks again. I really mean it.'%K%P",
  "'No problem.\\nI'm happy to help you out anytime.'%K%P",
  "'You know... Talking to you like this helped me\\nremember something really important.'%K%P",
  "'What's that?'%K%P",
  "'I want to make lots of people smile.'%K%P",
  "'That's the whole reason I wanted to be an idol\\nin the first place!'%K%P",
  "Kagura's smile was truly dazzling now.%K%P",
  "Seeing it made me more sure than ever that\\nI was right.%K%P",
  "Kagura had the potential to rise to the top\\nof the idol world.%K%P",
  "Higher than Shuri...\\nEven higher than L☆SEVEN!%K%P",
  "'I'm ready to give it my all.\\nSo, uh... Nice to be working with you again.'%K%P",
  "'It's good to have you back. Let's get to it!'%K%P",
  "I doubt I could have felt happier\\ngiving my response to Kagura.%K%P",
  "This was a brand new start for Kagura and me!%K%P"
