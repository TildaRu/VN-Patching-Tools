  "Pulling aside the door curtain, I arrived back at our\\nkimono shop, 'Tatsumi's'.%K%P",
  "Being one of the Tatsumis on the sign, I live here,\\nin a living space at the back of the shop.%K%P",
  "'There's no one manning the shop, AGAIN.\\nThey're asking for trouble...'%K%P",
  "Mother and father weren't that old, but maybe\\ninheriting this ancient kimono shop gave them\\nold fashioned ideas.%K%P",
  "Despite all the valuable kimono stored here,\\nthey often left without locking the door.%K%P",
  "Luckily, here in Kanda there were a lot of old\\nwholesalers and small shops, and everyone looks out\\nfor each other, so we've not had any trouble so far.%K%P",
  "'Hmm... Someone's here?'%K%P",
  "Someone was in the back of the shop.%K%P",
  "My mother? Or perhaps...%K%P",

  "I had been moved by Shuri's passionate singing,\\nbut Sara's healing voice held another kind of\\nenchantment.%K%P",

  "Her womanly curves gave rise to all kinds of ideas.%K%P",
  "It grew hard to breathe,\\nand my heart pounded loud in my ears.%K%P",
  "I couldn't leave, nor could I move closer,\\nI was frozen in place.%K%P",
  "'Huh...?'%K%P",
  "Sara's humming stopped.%K%P",
  "The breeze from the window gently\\nfluttered her light robe.%K%P",
  "I couldn't see her skin, but then\\nSara's attention fell from her song.%K%P",
  "In that instant, the spell fell from me, as well.%K%P",
  "'Yamato...?'%K%P",
  "Her gaze turned toward the shop entrance...\\nToward me.%K%P",
  "'S-Sara...'%K%P",
  "'Heehee, welcome back.'%K%P",
  "Saying nothing of my peeping,\\nshe just welcomed me with a soft smile.%K%P"
