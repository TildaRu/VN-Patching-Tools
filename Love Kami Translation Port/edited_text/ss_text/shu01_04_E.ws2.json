  "'The auditions for L☆SEVEN are now underway!\\nThe five goddesses who made it through the qualifier\\nare facing off for the crown!'%K%P",
  "'There she is...'%K%P",
  "My sister was up on the big\\nAkihabara screen again today.%K%P",
  "Replacing Sara's retirement statement,\\nthis announcement was for the main auditions.%K%P",
  "Rather than Sara's bright cheerfulness,\\nshe was popular for her cold, strong demeanor.%K%P",
  "People said she looked just as good in men's attire,\\nand honestly she had a ton of girl fans.%K%P",
  "'But that's not what she's really like...'%K%P",
  "The sister I know is a kind goddess,\\nfull of warmhearted compassion.%K%P",
  "She can be harsh, but not just that,\\nshe can be really thoughtful too.%K%P",
  "Because I love her so much, I wanted to stand\\nbeside her, so I thought I could join L☆SEVEN.%K%P",
  "'I thought it was a good idea...'%K%P",
  "I figured she'd be happy.\\nBut I was just being silly, I know that now.%K%P",
  "I took out my smartphone\\nand looked at her message again.%K%P",
  "[Shuri, you could never be a Divine Idol.\\nWithdraw your audition entry.]%K%P",
  "Not 'congratulations.'\\nNo 'Good job!'%K%P",
  "Instead, she sent a cold order.%K%P",
  "They were harsh words,\\nnegating everything I did with Love☆Kami.%K%P",
  "Of course, I thought I should try to explain.\\nI had faith she would understand\\nif we could just talk.%K%P",
  "But she was too busy to answer her phone.\\nAnd she wouldn't respond to my texts.%K%P",
  "I really just wanted to meet and talk face to face.\\nBut she said we couldn't, so I gave up.%K%P",
  "[Why didn't you talk to me first?\\nYou just went and did it, now it's my problem.]%K%P",
  "She was angry.\\nNot only that, she flat out said I was\\ncausing her problems.%K%P",
  "Being in the audition was causing problems for her.%K%P",
  "I guessed maybe the sister of an active L☆SEVEN\\nmember signing up might cause some trouble.%K%P",
  "I could have figured that out\\nif I had just thought about it a little.%K%P",
  "'Oh, what am I going to do, I got her in trouble...'%K%P",
  "I know she told me to quit\\nbecause she's angry.%K%P",
  "But I don't want to quit after coming so far.\\nI made it through the qualifier,\\nI don't want to stop now.%K%P",
  "[Please.\\nJust listen to what I have to say.]%K%P",
  "I knew if we could just talk, she'd understand.%K%P",
  "Saying a little prayer, I sent the message.%K%P",
  "[Fine.\\nI'll find the time for a phone call.]%K%P",
  "[Thank you!\\nI'll be waiting!]%K%P",
  "'Maybe I should have waited at home...'%K%P",
  "I'd chosen this park for a quiet spot to talk.%K%P",
  "I've been waiting for her call for about two hours now.%K%P",
  "People slowly disappeared from the Akihabara streets.%K%P",
  "'Still nothing...'%K%P",
  "I hated waiting like this alone.%K%P",
  "If I called Yamato, I bet he'd come running.%K%P",
  "No, I couldn't do that.\\nI couldn't keep asking Yamato for everything.'%K%P",
  "I couldn't let myself depend too much on him.%K%P",
  "I could trust him,\\nbut he wouldn't be there forever.%K%P",
  "Sooner or later, he'd leave.\\nI had to prepare myself for that now.%K%P",
  "'Oh, it's ringing!'%K%P",
  "Sis finally called me.%K%P",
  "'Hello, Shuri? It's me.'%K%P",
  "It'd been so long since I'd heard her voice,\\neven over the phone it was soothing.%K%P",
  "'I don't have much time. Keep it short.'%K%P",
  "'I'm sorry, sis.\\nSo, listen, about the audition...'%K%P",
  "'If that's what this is about, I already told you.\\nWithdraw, now.'%K%P",
  "'But I want to keep going!\\nI want to win the audition, and sing with you!'%K%P",
  "'I understand that.\\nBut it's not easy being a Divine Idol!\\nIt's so much harder than you can imagine.'%K%P",
  "'Shuri, you're such a sweet girl.\\nI just don't think you can handle this industry.\\nIt's too harsh.'%K%P",
  "'You went through the qualifier.\\nDidn't that show you how hard being a Divine Idol is?\\nIf you keep going, the stress will only get worse!'%K%P",
  "It really is hard to be a Divine Idol.\\nHaving tried it I fully understood,\\nher warning wasn't needed.%K%P",
  "'Well if that's the case... Then what about you?'%K%P",
  "'Hmm?'%K%P",
  "'After Sara retires,\\nit's only going to get worse for you.\\nYou haven't had a day off in ages!'%K%P",
  "I've wanted to talk,\\nbut I could never get hold of her.%K%P",
  "It's not that she was ignoring me,\\nshe was just too busy.%K%P",
  "'I'm fine. I'm not so weak\\nI'd let a little suffering break me.'%K%P",
  "'But you're not like that, right?\\nPlease, I'm begging you,\\ndon't make me keep worrying about you.'%K%P",
  "'...And it looks like I'm out of time.\\nQuit all this Divine Idol stuff. Please, Shuri.'%K%P",
  "'Wait!'%K%P",
  "But she hung up on me without another word.%K%P",
  "I wanted to talk more, but I knew\\nshe was really busy with Sara quitting and all.%K%P",
  "I could see she had so much to do\\nshe couldn't even talk, which was likely\\none reason why she didn't want me joining.%K%P",
  "'I know she's just worried about me...'%K%P",
  "'But she's also being overprotective.'%K%P",
  "She always treats me as her kid sister.%K%P",
  "She was always standing and fighting,\\nlike she was protecting me.%K%P",
  "Always so strong, I looked up to her for that.\\nI thought it would be so nice to be like her.%K%P",
  "And some day, I hoped we could support each other\\nas sisters.%K%P",
  "'I guess to her\\nI'm still just a helpless kid.'%K%P",
  "That was why she felt like she couldn't rely on me.\\nShe wouldn't let me fight alongside her.\\nThat thought made me so sad.%K%P",
  "I knew I had to show her that I had grown,\\nthat I was someone she could depend on.%K%P",
  "'Her voice sounded tired.\\nWith Sara gone, she has so much more responsibility.'%K%P",
  "She might even be the next center...%K%P",
  "If so, then things would definitely get harder.%K%P",
  "'Everyone relies on Sara, but at the same time\\nshe can get people to do what she wants.'%K%P",
  "'There's no way sis will be able to do it so well.'%K%P",
  "No matter how hard things get,\\nshe'll try to do it all alone.%K%P",
  "As her sister, I understood that much.\\nThat's just the way she is.%K%P",
  "'So that means I have to be there to help her out!'%K%P",
  "She wouldn't let anyone else help,\\nso I had to stay by her side.%K%P",
  "And so I had to hurry.\\nThis time, it was my turn to protect my big sister.%K%P",
  "'Just getting into L☆SEVEN won't be enough.\\nThat's just a means to an end,\\njust a checkpoint on the journey.'%K%P",
  "I wouldn't be her weak little sister,\\nI'd become a comrade in arms.%K%P",
  "And to do that, I had to achieve my first goal.%K%P",
  "'I'm not ready... I have to get stronger...'%K%P",
  "My hopes grew stronger, deeper.%K%P",
  "I could not lose this fight.\\nI would win, and I would be chosen as\\nthe next member of L☆SEVEN.%K%P"
