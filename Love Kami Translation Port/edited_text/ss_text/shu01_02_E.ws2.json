  "'Hmmm...'%K%P",
  "Shuri had been staring at her phone for a while now.%K%P",
  "'What's wrong, Shuri?\\nYou worried about the stock market or something?'%K%P",
  "'Um, no? I'm waiting for my sister to answer me.'%K%P",
  "'I'm not really sure,\\nbut won't it buzz or something when it comes?'%K%P",
  "'Well, yeah...'%K%P",
  "She didn't need to sit there and have this\\nstaring contest with her phone.%K%P",
  "Shuri was fully aware of this.%K%P",
  "'Let it be, come on, let's have a toast!'%K%P",
  "'Oh ho, that's right!\\nShuri, put that down and pick up a glass!'%K%P",
  "'Well, since both members of Love☆Kami made it to\\nthe finals, congratulations!'%K%P",
  "'Cheers!'%K%P",
  "The day after the qualifier results were announced,\\nthe three of us met up at Kagura's work to celebrate.%K%P",
  "While it was hard to be completely happy due to\\nSara's announcement, I thought it would be a good way\\nto cheer everyone up.%K%P",
  "'I'm just glad we made it through the qualifier!'%K%P",
  "'You were touch and go until the very end, though.'%K%P",
  "'Yeah, I'm jealous, you were set early on!\\nI was on edge the whole time, you know.'%K%P",
  "'Well, I'm glad you made it!\\nCongratulations, Kagura.'%K%P",
  "'Thanks. Congrats to you too, Shuri!'%K%P",
  "Things finally started to feel normal\\nafter we enjoyed a nice meal.%K%P",
  "Shuri's dark mood even lightened up again.%K%P",
  "Now that the celebration had settled down,\\nit was time to think about the main event.%K%P",
  "'OK then, now that we're headed to the main audition,\\nWe need to talk about what we're going to do...'%K%P",
  "We had about one month until the audition.\\nLove☆Kami had built a lot of popularity, but in\\nterms of actual skill we still had cause for concern.%K%P",
  "From now on the fanbases would be irrelevant,\\nand it would become purely a contest of ability.%K%P",
  "'That practice spot has gotten famous, apparently.\\nWith all the fans there,\\nit might be kind of hard to use.'%K%P",
  "'You can't let attention from the fans bother you.\\nIf you get embarrassed by a little attention,\\nyou won't be able to survive in L☆SEVEN.'%K%P",
  "'Shuri's right.\\nAnyway, isn't it good to feel a little tension?'%K%P",
  "'Well, if that's the way it is,\\nthen we could just borrow the stage here again.'%K%P",
  "Love☆Kami had given a performance here\\nduring the final push at the end of the qualifiers.%K%P",
  "Since Kagura worked here, they were accommodating.%K%P",
  "'More importantly, just how long do we plan to\\ncontinue with Love☆Kami?\\nWe two are competitors in the main voting, you know.'%K%P",
  "'...I guess that means we can't do this together?'%K%P",
  "'Of course it does.'%K%P",
  "Shuri turned a cold shoulder to Kagura's hinting.%K%P",
  "She clearly thought they shouldn't keep up their duo.%K%P",
  "'Well, even if we're rivals\\nwe're still friends, right?'%K%P",
  "'...I'd certainly like to think so. What about you?'%K%P",
  "'Of course, me too!\\nShuri, you've been my bestie for ages!'%K%P",
  "The rather casual re-ranking to 'bestie' aside,\\nKagura seemed happy to be able to\\nreaffirm their friendship.%K%P",
  "'This means I can go ahead and compete with you.'%K%P",
  "'I'm looking forward to it.\\nLet's show each other our very best performance!'%K%P",
  "The two came to an understanding\\nthanks to Shuri's guidance.%K%P",
  "'And so, what'll happen to Love☆Kami?'%K%P",
  "'I guess we'll go on break?'%K%P",
  "'Yeah, if I'm going to beat Shuri,\\nI'll have to really buckle down.'%K%P",
  "So there were no objections from Kagura, either.%K%P",
  "'OK then, what about me?'%K%P",
  "'...Oh.'%K%P",
  "'I'm sorry, I totally forgot about you...'%K%P",
  "'Don't forget me!\\nI fought alongside you in the qualifier, too!'%K%P",
  "Love☆Kami wasn't just two people, it was a trio.\\nWhere did all that heartfelt support go?%K%P",
  "'But, if you only help one of us, Yamato,\\nit wouldn't be fair.'%K%P",
  "'That's right!\\nBut we'll make Yamato cry if we leave him out...'%K%P",
  "'I won't cry!'%K%P",
  "'Oh, so you're OK with being left out?'%K%P",
  "'Sorry, Yamato.\\nThis is all just part of our showdown.\\nYou'll just have to be okay on your own for a bit.'%K%P",
  "'You guys...'%K%P",
  "'Mwahahaaah! I'm joking!\\nIt's really not that big a deal, whatever you do.'%K%P",
  "'Yeah, Kagura's right.\\nYou can just kind of hang about, like you always do.'%K%P",
  "'So nothing's changing?'%K%P",
  "I grumbled.\\nIt looked like no one wanted to pin down my new role.%K%P",
  "With the two of them going\\ninto serious competition, I could understand\\nthem wanting to keep me around for comfort.%K%P",
  "I too, was happier keeping my position vague.%K%P"
