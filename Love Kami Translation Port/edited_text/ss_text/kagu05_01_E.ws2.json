  "'...'%K%P",
  "The best thing would be to ask her where we stood\\nand get it all out in the open.%K%P",

  "'Whoa! K-Kagura?'%K%P",
  "I nearly fell backwards as\\nKagura jumped forward and hugged me tight.%K%P",
  "Somehow I managed to wrap my own arms around her.\\nI felt the familiar sensation of something soft.%K%P",
  "'So this is how it feels to like someone.\\nMy heart's pounding like crazy...'%K%P",
  "'It sure is...'%K%P",
  "Kagura's chest was pressed so close to me\\nthat I could feel her heartbeat.%K%P",
  "My pulse was just as fast,\\nmaybe even more so.%K%P",
  "'It's not a bad feeling, though.\\nI kind of want to make it even more intense...'%K%P",
  "'I think I know a way we can do that,\\nwant to give it a try?'%K%P",
  "'Really? Sure, let's try it!'%K%P",
