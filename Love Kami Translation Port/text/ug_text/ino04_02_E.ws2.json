"After breakfast, we finished cleaning and I waited\\nfor Inori outside of Tsubaki.%K%P",
"'I'm ready to go.'%K%P",
"'Wow, that outfit suits you well.'%K%P",
"'Y-You think so?'%K%P",
"Just like the first time I laid eyes on her-Inori\\nlooked great in traditional Japanese-style\\nclothes with her lustrous black hair.%K%P",
"'Thanks for changing into this.'%K%P",
"'Thank you for requesting it.\\nAnyway, it's nothing, really.'%K%P",
"She's more than I deserve, she was\\nthe cutest girlfriend.%K%P",
"'Now, shall we?'%K%P",
"'Yes!'%K%P",
"Inori walked right next to me.%K%P",
"Inori and I chatted while we walked\\nthrough Kannagi.%K%P",
"I've seen the many faces of Inori, and she seemed\\nmore cheerful now than ever before.%K%P",
"'You've changed, Inori.'%K%P",
"'Do you think so?'%K%P",
"'You've mellowed out since I met you.\\nYou seem more content these days.'%K%P",
"In the beginning, Inori gave off this tense air.%K%P",
"But that tenseness had faded recently.%K%P",
"'Yes, you might be right.\\nI think I may have been\\ntoo fervent about work.%K%P",
"'But, since I started living at Tsubaki and spent\\nmore time with you guys, I realized that\\nI shouldn't be so stiff.'%K%P",
"'While I do believe austerity is necessary\\nas a goddess, I didn't need to be like that\\nall the time.'%K%P",
"'I was able to realize that because of you guys.\\nPlus, the townspeople have been talking to me\\ntoo recently!'%K%P",
"'It makes me happy.'%K%P",
"Her genuine smile was very beautiful, making me fall\\nin love with her all over again.%K%P",
"'I can't help it...'%K%P",
"'Help what?'%K%P",
"'I just love you, Inori.'%K%P",
"'What? Th-Thank you...'%K%P",
"Inori tilted her head and wondered why\\nI said that out of the blue.%K%P",
"I adored Inori very much.%K%P",
"We kept on walking and arrived at the park.%K%P",
"Since it was during the day, there was no sign\\nof anyone else.%K%P",
"Taking a walk in the park on a weekday like this\\nwas refreshing.%K%P",
"'It's so nice and quiet here.'%K%P",
"'Hmm...'%K%P",
"When I looked over, Inori was staring at me.%K%P",
"'Inori? Is there something on my face?'%K%P",
"'Hm? Are you the usual Sho?'%K%P",
"After she said that, she continued to stare.%K%P",
"'Hmm...'%K%P",
"Was she doing it unconsciously?%K%P",
"Why was she staring at me like that?%K%P",
"I continued to walk through the park, puzzled,\\nand I noticed how Inori's hands were\\nmoving unnaturally.%K%P",
"Ah, I see what's going on.%K%P",
"'Excuse me.'%K%P",
"'Oh!'%K%P",
"I tightly wrapped Inori's hand around my\\nvacant hand.%K%P",
"'I'm sorry it took so long for me to realize.'%K%P",
"'N-No! I'm just happy about the fact that you\\neven realized it!'%K%P",
"Inori squeezed my hand back.%K%P",
"I was glad my intuition was right.%K%P",
"The warmth from her hand soothed me like no other,\\neven if we were just holding hands.%K%P",
"'It's strange. We're just holding hands, but I can\\nsense your feelings and it makes me so happy.%K%P",
"'Me too. I feel you close to me and it's makes\\nmy heart beat faster.'%K%P",
"As we held each other's hands, we continued to\\nwalk around the park.%K%P",
"We visited Inori's shrine after grocery shopping\\nsince she wanted to.%K%P",
"'Over here, Sho.'%K%P",
"I followed her lead and sat at the open corridor\\nof the main shrine.%K%P",
"'Please wait here for a moment.'%K%P",
"She then disappeared into the back of\\nthe main shrine.%K%P",
"While I waited for Inori, I looked around\\nthe grounds.%K%P",
"'I confessed my love to Inori here.'%K%P",
"The memory was still vivid in my mind.%K%P",
"'Her lips were so soft.'%K%P",
"I smiled as I remembered the sensation of our kiss.%K%P",
"'Sorry to keep you waiting.'%K%P",
"I heard Inori's voice from behind.%K%P",
"'Welcome back. So, what was it that you wanted\\nto do?'%K%P",
"'Heheh, actually, it's this.'%K%P",
"'Ear cleaning?'%K%P",
"'Yes. I always dreamed of cleaning my\\nboyfriend's ears. But only if you'd like it...\\nWhat do you think?'%K%P",
"'Of course.\\nI would love that.'%K%P",
"'Heheh. Then please lay on your side.'%K%P",
"I laid my head on Inori's lap as I was told.%K%P",
"This was a first for me and it felt\\nexceptionally good.%K%P",
"Especially...%K%P",
"'This view...'%K%P",
"As she leaned over to clean my ears, her chest\\ngot closer to my face.%K%P",
"I only got tiny glimpse of them earlier, so now\\nthat I got to see them up close,\\nthey were incredible.%K%P",
"'I'm going to start.'%K%P",
"'Please.'%K%P",
"Inori's hands touched my head and the ear pick\\nentered my ears.%K%P",
"'Please tell me if it hurts.'%K%P",
"Inori's hands slowly started to move.%K%P",
"'Wow, this...'%K%P",
"I was a kid the last time someone else cleaned\\nmy ears and it sure felt good!%K%P",
"'Inori, you're good at this.'%K%P",
"'Really? It makes me happy that you think that.'%K%P",
"As she smiled, her large chest swayed in\\nthe corner of my view.%K%P",
"I couldn't get enough of it.%K%P",
"'I'm going to blow a little air, okay?'%K%P",
"Her breath tickled my ear and a tingling sensation\\nwent down my spine.%K%P",
"'Oh, I found a bigger one. There.'%K%P",
"Seeing Inori having so much fun cleaning my ears\\nmade me happy.%K%P",
"'Does it feel good?'%K%P",
"'So good, that I want it to last forever.'%K%P",
"'Heheh, you're exaggerating.\\nBut, I'll be happy to do this for you\\nwhenever you'd like.'%K%P",
"'Really?'%K%P",
"I'm probably going to ask her to do it a lot.%K%P",
"'Of course. I'm your girlfriend.'%K%P",
"'That's why you're into doing the chores lately.'%K%P",
"'Y-Yes. Now that I'm your girlfriend, I t-thought\\nI'd practice homemaking.'%K%P",
"Practice homemaking?%K%P",
"Inori was so dedicated, of course she already\\nthought that far when we just got together.%K%P",
"'Um, does that bother you?'%K%P",
"'No way. It makes me so happy that you\\nthink of us so much.'%K%P",
"I also had no plans to break up with Inori.%K%P",
"That's why I had to do my best to keep her\\ninterested as well.%K%P",
"'By the way, can a goddess have a child with\\na human?'%K%P",
"'There's no problem there. As we see in\\nmany legends, goddesses can conceive\\nchildren with humans.'%K%P",
"'Plus, there are other goddesses out there whose\\nlovers are human as well.'%K%P",
"'Huh, I see.\\nSo there are other couples\\nlike us out there.'%K%P",
"It's been years since goddesses started living\\namong people, of course we weren't the first.%K%P",
"'Then, today's cooking was part of your\\nhomemaking training.'%K%P",
"'Yes, but I'm still very far from Maika's level.'%K%P",
"'Maika is my childhood friend.'%K%P",
"'I know! And she's so knowledgeable\\nabout your preferences!'%K%P",
"'So I have to step it up!'%K%P",
"I see.%K%P",
"Maika was a mentor, and at the same time,\\na barrier she wanted to overcome.%K%P",
"'I'm looking forward to it.'%K%P",
"'Yes! I'll learn all your likes and dislikes\\nright away!'%K%P",
"'But before that, I must finish cleaning your ears.\\nThey're still a bit stuffed up.'%K%P",
"She went back to ear cleaning and her\\nchest came even closer.%K%P",
"Ah, I've finally found my paradise.%K%P",
"That's how I felt seeing Inori's chest sway\\nback and forth.%K%P",
"The autumn breeze also felt good.%K%P",
"Experiencing the pleasure of getting my ears\\ncleaned by Inori in the most comfortable weather\\nmade my eyelids heavy.%K%P",
"'All done... Sho?'%K%P",
"'...'%K%P",
"'He fell asleep.'%K%P",
"I caressed Sho's head like a child in my lap.%K%P",
"'Love is such a strange thing.'%K%P",
"The more I learned about him, the more I spent time\\nwith him, the more I loved him.%K%P",
"I never imagined to ever feel this way.%K%P",
"'I thought this earlier this morning too, but you\\nlook like a child when you're asleep.'%K%P",
"I poked at his cheek.%K%P",
"It wasn't as soft as I was expecting.\\nHe was indeed no child.%K%P",
"'...'%K%P",
"I moved my finger and got to his lips.%K%P",
"'Oh yeah, this was where we had our first kiss.'%K%P",
"As I remembered our first kiss, I couldn't\\nkeep my eyes off of Sho.%K%P",
"'...'%K%P",
"'Are you asleep?'%K%P",
"I spoke to him lightly and got no response.%K%P",
"'Sh-Sho. If you don't wake up, I'm gonna kiss you?'%K%P",
"I purposely said to try and wake him up,\\nbut still got no response.%K%P",
"'...'%K%P",
"'I'm really gonna kiss you.'%K%P",
"I let out a breath out of nervousness and kissed Sho\\non his cheek while he was asleep.%K%P",
"'Hm...'%K%P",
"I secretly kissed Sho.%K%P",
"I felt an inexplicable sense of immorality\\nstir up inside me.%K%P",
"'No... That wasn't enough at all.'%K%P",
"I really wanted to kiss him on the lips, but\\nthat would wake him up.%K%P",
"That's why I pecked at his cheek over and\\nover again.%K%P",
"'Muah... M-Muah, muah.'%K%P",
"I started to wake up when I felt something on my\\ncheek and saw that Inori was kissing me.%K%P",
"'Inori?'%K%P",
"'Ah!'%K%P",
"When I called her, she reacted like a child who\\ngot caught doing mischief.%K%P",
"'Sh-Sh-Sh-Sho?! S-S-ince when were you awake?!'%K%P",
"'Just now. Were you...just kissing me?'%K%P",
"'Ah, uh, yes.'%K%P",
"Her face turned bright red as her body curled up.%K%P",
"'I'm sorry...'%K%P",
"'No, no. I'm not mad.'%K%P",
"ã€€'I wasn't even awake, so now you have\\nto kiss me again. Oh, and on\\nthe lips of course.'%K%P",
"'A-Ahh...'%K%P",
"Seeing Inori all nervous, coming to kiss me was\\nso extremely satisfying.%K%P"
