"Maika and I finished cleaning and went to the\\nkitchen together.%K%P",
"'This is hard.'%K%P",
"'You can be surprisingly clumsy sometimes.'%K%P",
"'Don't worry, I'll get the hang of it soon enough.'%K%P",
"'Good, I'm expecting great things from you.'%K%P",
"In the midst of our back and forth, I snuck\\na glance at Maika.%K%P",
"We were still both avoiding the subject of whatever\\nit was she was worried about.%K%P",
"Somehow I couldn't just let it go.%K%P",
"Come to think of it, why was I so desperate to listen\\nto Maika's problems anyway?%K%P",
"'...Ow!'%K%P",
"My attention had started to wander, and the kitchen\\nknife I was holding slipped and cut my finger.%K%P",
"'Sho! Are you okay?!'%K%P",
"'Yowch... Yeah, I'm fine.'%K%P",
"'Y-You're bleeding...\\nWe've got to do something!\\nUh, let's see...uh...'%K%P",
"'Urgh, there's so much blood!\\nWhat do I do?!'%K%P",
"'Maybe a band-aid?\\nWill that do any good?'%K%P",
"Seeing Maika in such a panic actually helped\\nme to stay calm.%K%P",
"It almost felt like all this was happening\\nto someone else.%K%P",
"'Okay, okay...\\nFirst we've got to clean the wound!'%K%P",
"'Huh?'%K%P",
"A wet warmth suddenly engulfed my finger.%K%P",
"'Mn... *Slurp*...*Lick*'%K%P",
"Maika was licking the wound clean.\\nIt didn't hurt. In fact, this sensation\\nwas something else entirely.%K%P",
"In a weird way, it felt kinda good...%K%P",
"'M-Maika?'%K%P",
"'Mmm... Ah, sorry. Does it hurt?'%K%P",
"'No, it's great--\\nNo, wait! I mean,\\nwhat are you doing?!'%K%P",
"'What do you mean?'%K%P",
"'I mean, why are you licking my finger?'%K%P",
"'Ah!'%K%P",
"As she finally realized what she was doing,\\nMaika's face went bright red.%K%P",
"'I-I-It's not... I mean, this is... Sorry, you must\\nthink I'm a total weirdo.'%K%P",
"'No, not at all!\\nYou can lick it some more\\nif you want!'%K%P",
"Wait, what the heck did I just say?!%K%P",
"'Oh, so you want more?'%K%P",
"'Th-That's not really what I meant,\\nI just kinda got caught up\\nin the moment...'%K%P",
"'So then, you don't want me to?'%K%P",
"Why did she look so disappointed?%K%P",
"'Well, I didn't say that...'%K%P",
"'Really?'%K%P",
"'Yeah.'%K%P",
"This time it was my turn to blush.%K%P",
"How did we even get into this situation?%K%P",
"'Heehee... Let's get back to it.'%K%P",
"Maika looked up into my face.%K%P",
"When our eyes met, my heart started to pound.%K%P",
"'B-Back to what?'%K%P",
"'Cleaning the wound, of course...'%K%P",
"'Don't get the wrong idea! I just don't want it\\nto get infected, and there's no point in\\nstopping halfway...right?'%K%P",
"She was trembling slightly, as if she was\\nafraid I'd say no.%K%P",
"For a moment I stopped thinking of her as my\\nchildhood friend, and just saw her as a\\nvery attractive young woman.%K%P",
"'R-Right... Go ahead.'%K%P",
"'Okay...'%K%P",
"'*Lick* Mmm... Mm...'%K%P",
"Was this scenario always so sensual?%K%P",
"There was silence, apart from the echo\\nof the ticking clock and the sound of Maika's\\ntongue running over my finger.%K%P",
"'*Slurp* Ahh... Sho...?'%K%P",
"'Ngh...'%K%P",
"Maika looked up at me again, still blushing deeply.%K%P",
"Her eyes were beginning to tear up, perhaps\\nbecause of the unbearable tension in the room.%K%P",
"I knew Maika was pretty, but being with her in\\nthis steamy situation seemed to make\\nher beauty even more intense.%K%P",
"'M-Maika.'%K%P",
"Was she always this cute?%K%P",
"I'd never really thought about it before.%K%P",
"We'd been friends for so many years, why was I only\\nbecoming aware of it now?%K%P",
"Or maybe I'd subconsciously been trying not to\\nthink about it?%K%P",
"Just as things were starting to feel awkward...%K%P",
"'Sho, Maika, what 'til you hear this!\\nThat stupid boss of ours--'%K%P",
"'Wha?!'%K%P",
"The door swung open and Akane came charging in.%K%P",
"Surprised and completely off-guard, Maika and I\\nsprang away from each other.%K%P",
"'Huh? What's up with you two?'%K%P",
"'N-Nothing! Everything's totally normal\\naround here. Right, Maika?'%K%P",
"'Yeah! Of course! We weren't doing anything weird!'%K%P",
"'Uh, okay, sure.\\nWhy are you acting like you've got\\nsomething to hide, then?'%K%P",
"'Never mind about that!\\nDidn't you have some news for us?\\nYou sounded pretty mad.'%K%P",
"'Oh yeah. So, get this, our dumb boss says\\nshe won't recognize all the work\\nI've been doing!'%K%P",
"'Huh? What happened?'%K%P",
"'Haaah...ahhh... Akane, you run too fast...'%K%P",
"Before we could get any details, Inori arrived,\\npanting and out of breath.%K%P",
"'Welcome back, Inori.'%K%P",
"'Yeah, welcome back.'%K%P",
"'Ahhh... *Gasp* Th-Thank you...'%K%P",
"'Why don't you sit down?\\nI'll get us all some tea.'%K%P",
"I glanced at Maika.%K%P",
"The seductive atmosphere that surrounded\\nher before was gone now.%K%P",
"'Aaah, I feel so much better now.'%K%P",
"After Inori had a chance to catch her breath and\\ndrink some tea, we got back to the matter at\\nhand.%K%P",
"'So, what happened between you and your boss?'%K%P",
"'Urgh, I don't know where to start!\\nShe said what I'm doing right now\\ndoesn't count as real rehab!'%K%P",
"'She got mad at you, then?'%K%P",
"Akane didn't reply, she just turned away\\nwith a sulky look on her face.%K%P",
"'The problem may be a little more serious\\nthan you realize...'%K%P",
"Inori proceeded to fill us in on the details\\nof the meeting.%K%P",
"'So, the goddess in charge of you thinks Akane's\\njust playing around?'%K%P",
"'That's right. She said we ought to take this more\\nseriously, and...well...'%K%P",
"'More bad news?'%K%P",
"Inori shifted uncomfortably before answering.%K%P",
"'Our boss said we should start finding you\\nnew accommodation.'%K%P",
"'Does that mean what I think it means?'%K%P",
"Judging by this report, Inori's boss wasn't\\nexpecting Akane's rehabilitation to be a success.%K%P",
"The demolition of Tsubaki Apartments was\\nalready a given in her eyes.%K%P",
"'I-I contested the decision, of course!\\nWe should still continue trying.'%K%P",
"For now, huh?%K%P",
"However long that was, it didn't feel like we\\nhad a lot of time left.%K%P",
"We'd needed to think up some new plan.%K%P",
"No ideas occurred to any of us right then, though.%K%P",
"'...'%K%P",
"Sitting beside me, Maika was lost in thought,\\nher expression unreadable.%K%P",
"We talked for a little longer, eventually deciding\\nto carry on as we had been doing for now.%K%P",
"I went back to my room and lay down, thinking over\\nall the things we discussed.%K%P",
"'Tsubaki Apartments...'%K%P",
"I'd lived here for so long.%K%P",
"Naturally, it was a place I felt attached to,\\nthat I wanted to protect.%K%P",
"But it was the memories of the times I'd\\nshared here with Maika that really felt important.%K%P",
"'Maika...'%K%P",
"I mumbled her name and looked at the cut\\non my finger.%K%P",
"I recalled the way it had felt when Maika licked it,\\nand felt my face going red.%K%P",
"Maika was all I could think about.%K%P",
"'What is wrong with me?'%K%P",
"I really should've been thinking about how to save\\nTsubaki, but I'd just been\\nthinking about Maika instead.%K%P",
"'Stop being weird.'%K%P",
"'Huh? Stop doing what now?'%K%P",
"A few days had passed. I was still thinking about\\nMaika when Akane confronted me.%K%P",
"'You and Maika. The last few days you haven't\\nbeen yourselves.'%K%P",
"'Why don't you two talk anymore?'%K%P",
"'Oh, I noticed that, too.\\nYou always look away\\nwhen you make eye contact.'%K%P",
"'Did you get into a fight with Maika?'%K%P",
"'A fight? Not exactly...'%K%P",
"'What, then?'%K%P",
"'Well...'%K%P",
"I didn't really know how to answer.%K%P",
"'Now that I think about it... The two of you started\\nacting strangely after we got back from the meeting\\nwith our boss.'%K%P",
"'Did something happen while we were away?'%K%P",
"Their eyes bore into me.%K%P",
"'If you've got a problem, you can always tell us.'%K%P",
"'You helped me out before, remember?\\nLet me return the favor.'%K%P",
"'I might not be able to do much,\\nbut we've got Inori here for\\nany serious stuff.'%K%P",
"'That's right, Sho. I'd be glad to help out if you\\nneed someone to talk to.'%K%P",
"'Akane... Inori...'%K%P",
"They had a point. If I kept this to myself\\nI'd just keep running around in circles\\nand be no good to anyone.%K%P",
"Maybe it would be better to talk about it.\\nIt seemed like I could at least expect some\\nsympathy from the two goddesses.%K%P",
"'Okay, it's like this...'%K%P",
"I told them everything that had happened,\\nnot holding back any details.%K%P",
"'Ah, I see.'%K%P",
"'Yeah... Ever since then,\\nwhenever I see Maika I\\ncan't help but stare.'%K%P",
"Not only that, but I felt too nervous to talk to her\\nlike I usually would.%K%P",
"It was like I'd completely forgotten how to act\\nnormal in her presence.%K%P",
"'I wish I could relax around her, but...'%K%P",
"'Hmm... About that.'%K%P",
"Akane looked to Inori for approval.\\nInori nodded.%K%P",
"Did they have an idea already?%K%P",
"'It sounds like love.'%K%P",
"'L-Love?'%K%P",
"'We both think so. You like Maika, don't you?'%K%P",
"I...like...Maika?%K%P",
"'We're just childhood frie--'%K%P",
"'Sho.'%K%P",
"'I understand your not wanting to jeopardize a\\nfriendship you've had for so long.'%K%P",
"'But if you don't step outside that comfort zone,\\nyou may lose your chance at something even better.'%K%P",
"'Yeah, if you like her, you like her.\\nI think you two'd make a great couple.'%K%P",
"'Think about it this way - if this place did get\\nclosed down, you wouldn't want to get\\nseparated from Maika, would you?'%K%P",
"'...'%K%P",
"It didn't take long for me to come up with an answer.%K%P",
"'No. No, I wouldn't.'%K%P",
"Maika and I had been together for so long.%K%P",
"I didn't know what I'd do if she suddenly wasn't\\nthere by my side.%K%P",
"Was that just because I'd grown up with her?%K%P",
"'That's not it...'%K%P",
"I wanted to be the one to make Maika smile,\\nto make her happy, to be by her side.%K%P",
"'I get it now...'%K%P",
"It was just like Akane and Inori said.%K%P",
"'I like Maika's smile, I like watching her working\\nhard, I like the way she tries to hide her true\\nfeelings... I like everything about her.'%K%P",
"Just thinking about her made my heart swell up like\\nit might burst.%K%P",
"My happiest memories were of times I'd spent\\ntogether with Maika.%K%P",
"I was finally starting to realize just how much she\\nmeant to me.%K%P",
"'You're looking a lot happier all of a sudden.'%K%P",
"'Am I? It's thanks to you two if I am.'%K%P",
"'We were right, right? You do like Maika?'%K%P",
"'Yeah... You were right.'%K%P",
"'What will you do now?'%K%P",
"'Isn't it obvious?'%K%P",
"Now that I knew how I felt, there was no\\nturning back.%K%P",
"Even if she turned me down, even if this ruined our\\nfriendship, I just couldn't keep these feelings\\nto myself anymore.%K%P",
"'I'm going to tell her.'%K%P",
"'Yeah! Go for it!'%K%P",
"'I'm sure you'll be fine.\\nWe'll both be cheering for you.'%K%P",
"'Thanks. Do you think I could ask you for\\nsome more advice?'%K%P",
"'Huh?'%K%P",
"'What kind of advice?'%K%P",
"'I'm going to ask Maika out, but...maybe you could\\ntell me a little about what girls like in a guy?'%K%P",
"'Of course! I think we can handle that much.'%K%P",
"'We'll do anything to help out!'%K%P",
"I was so truly glad to have friends I could\\ncount on.%K%P",
"I took a long, deep breath and knocked on\\nMaika's door.%K%P",
"'Who is it?'%K%P",
"'It's me.'%K%P",
"'Sh-Sho? What do you want?'%K%P",
"'I want to ask you something. Can I come in?'%K%P",
"'Do you have to?'%K%P",
"'Yeah, it's kinda private.'%K%P",
"'P-Private?!'%K%P",
"Did I go too far?%K%P",
"'Sorry, that was inconsiderate of me.'%K%P",
"'I don't mind.'%K%P",
"'Really?'%K%P",
"'Yeah... Just wait a minute.'%K%P",
"'Okay, come in.'%K%P",
"I stepped into Maika's room.%K%P",
"'...'%K%P",
"'...'%K%P",
"I knew I was the one who'd asked to come in, but\\nbeing alone with Maika still made me nervous.%K%P",
"This was no time to clam up!%K%P",
"'Maika.'%K%P",
"'Y-Yes?'%K%P",
"I might have got awkward and looked away before,\\nbut now things were different.%K%P",
"Running from my feelings was no longer an option.%K%P",
"'Are you free tomorrow?'%K%P",
"'Huh? Tomorrow? Uh, I need to do some housework\\nin the morning, but otherwise...'%K%P",
"'Cool. Do you want to go on a date with me, then?'%K%P",
"'Oh, okay. Sure.'%K%P",
"'...Wait a minute.'%K%P",
"'Did you say 'date'?'%K%P",
"'Yep. A date.'%K%P",
"'Whaaat? A d-d-date? Wh-What do you think you're\\ndoing, asking me something like that?!'%K%P",
"'Is that a no?'%K%P",
"'No! I mean, not 'no', but...I'm just surprised, I\\nwasn't expecting this.'%K%P",
"I couldn't blame her.%K%P",
"'I know things have been kinda awkward between\\nus lately. This is kind of to make up for that, too.'%K%P",
"'I see... Okay. Let's do it.\\nLet's go...on a date.'%K%P",
"'Great. How about we meet up in Kannagi Park?'%K%P",
"'Meet up? We live in the same building,\\nwhy don't we just start out from here?'%K%P",
"'No way, meeting up somewhere first is part of the\\nfun of a date.'%K%P",
"'You sound like a starry-eyed young girl.'%K%P",
"'I do...?'%K%P",
"'Yeah, but I agree.\\nThat is part of the appeal.'%K%P",
"'Well, it is gonna be our first date.\\nI want to do this right.'%K%P",
"'Do you have to keep calling it a date?\\nAre you doing that on purpose?'%K%P",
"'Maybe I am, maybe I'm not.'%K%P",
"Honestly, I wanted to come out and tell her how I\\nfelt right then and there.%K%P",
"But I had to be patient.%K%P",
"First I needed to dispel the feeling of distance\\nthat still existed between us.%K%P",
"After that, I'd make my move.%K%P",
"'Is this time okay?'%K%P",
"'Sure. I should have finished everything I need to\\ndo by then.'%K%P",
"'Great. I'm really looking forward to this.'%K%P",
"'M-Me too...'%K%P",
"That way she shifted around all embarrassed\\nwas so darn cute!%K%P",
"'I-Is that all you needed?'%K%P",
"'Yeah. Sorry for barging in.'%K%P",
"'It's okay... See you tomorrow.'%K%P",
"'See you then.'%K%P",
"I left the room and heaved a sigh of relief.%K%P",
"'All right, now to draw up a plan of action.\\nI've gotta do all I can to make tomorrow a hit!'%K%P",
"I didn't know how this would change my\\nrelationship with Maika.%K%P",
"But as I walked back to my room, all I felt was\\nexcitement in anticipation of our date.%K%P"
