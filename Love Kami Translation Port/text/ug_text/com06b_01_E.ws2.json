"Since we decided to take a day off, Akane\\nimmediately rushed out of Tsubaki.%K%P",
"Maika had her own matters to tend to and left\\nthe living room after clearing out the dishes.%K%P",
"Inori and I were left in the living room.%K%P",
"We weren't having deep a conversation, but I\\ndidn't mind the mellow atmosphere either.%K%P",
"'Sho, would you like some tea?'%K%P",
"'You'll serve me some?'%K%P",
"'If you'll allow me.'%K%P",
"'Why, I'd love some please.'%K%P",
"'All right! Please wait a moment.'%K%P",
"As Inori slowly stood up and headed to the kitchen,\\nshe prepared the tea with experienced hands.%K%P",
"'Thank you for waiting.'%K%P",
"'Thank you very much.'%K%P",
"'Excuse me, I'm going to sit next to you.'%K%P",
"As Inori sat next to me, I caught a light peach-like\\nfragrance that tickled my nose.%K%P",
"I've been running around, working with Akane\\nrecently, so this felt very relaxing.%K%P",
"'I'm very confident with this tea, I'm sure\\nyou'll like it.'%K%P",
"'Really? Well then I'm excited.'%K%P",
"Urged by Inori, I took a sip of the tea.%K%P",
"'It's delicious.'%K%P",
"'I was taught by Maika how to do it.\\nI'm glad it suits your taste.'%K%P",
"As Inori smiled, it reminded me of what a\\nharmonious goddess she was.%K%P",
"My eyes were stuck on her silky black hair,\\nher quiet, elegant personality,\\nand her magnificent cleavage...%K%P",
"'Um, you're staring at me.\\nIs something wrong?'%K%P",
"'No, it's nothing.\\nAnyway, you don't have any plans for today?'%K%P",
"'Me? Well, I'm thinking of going to the shrine.'%K%P",
"'The shrine? You mean where you're enshrined\\nas a goddess?'%K%P",
"'Yes. It's been a while since I went back.\\nSo I'm thinking of cleaning it today.'%K%P",
"'You're gonna clean your own shrine?'%K%P",
"'It's like how you clean your own room.\\nThat shrine belongs to me,\\nso I should clean it myself.'%K%P",
"I admired how modest Inori was, even as a goddess.%K%P",
"'May I join you too?'%K%P",
"I decided to offer my help.%K%P",
"'Are you sure?\\nThere's nothing too special\\nat my shrine.'%K%P",
"'I'm not expecting to hang out.\\nI just want to help you.'%K%P",
"'You saved us many times during\\nAkane's rehabilitation, so I'd like to\\ntake this chance to repay you.'%K%P",
"'Oh no, you're the one who's saved us many times.\\nYou don't need to repay me...'%K%P",
"'But, since you're being generous...may I take you up\\non that offer?'%K%P",
"'Of course. We can clean your shrine together.'%K%P",
"'Heheh. Thank you very much.'%K%P",
"We smiled at each other as we finished\\nthe rest of the tea.%K%P",
"Inori's shrine was located on the corner of a\\nresidential area.%K%P",
"'So this is your shrine.\\nIt's quite impressive.'%K%P",
"While it stood in the middle of the neighborhood,\\nthe area was spread out with lush trees\\neverywhere.%K%P",
"'Yes. It is quite the impressive shrine.'%K%P",
"Inori said this while puffed up with pride.%K%P",
"It really was a majestic shrine.\\nOf course she'd be proud of it.%K%P",
"I looked around again and noticed the many names\\ncarved on the fence.%K%P",
"There were many stone pillars that formed a fence.\\nThey were carved with the names of people,\\ncompanies, and organizations.%K%P",
"'What's this, Inori?'%K%P",
"'Oh, those are the names of donors.'%K%P",
"Quite a number of groups and individuals had\\ncontributed to her shrine.%K%P",
"'Inori, you're very loved by the people here\\nas a goddess.'%K%P",
"'Yes, to the point where I felt it was\\nmore than I deserved.'%K%P",
"'Heh, that's a good thing. The people of Kannagi\\nknow what a great goddess you are.'%K%P",
"'I guess that's true. But because of that, I need to\\nwork even harder.'%K%P",
"'I think you're working hard enough now.'%K%P",
"'No... I can't even rehabilitate an Aragami yet.\\nI still have a long way to go.\\nI need to devote myself more.'%K%P",
"Inori was always diligent.%K%P",
"Seeing her work hard made me want to support her.%K%P",
"'If there's anything I can do,\\nplease let me know.'%K%P",
"'Yes, if anything comes up,\\nI'd like to count on you, Sho.'%K%P",
"Inori then bowed her head.%K%P",
"How modest could a goddess get?%K%P",
"'I don't mean to be rude, but I have to thank\\nAkane for running away.'%K%P",
"'Huh?'%K%P",
"'If Akane was serious about rehabilitation\\noff the bat, I don't think we would be\\nliving together like this.'%K%P",
"'Sorry, that's just my own, selfish opinion.'%K%P",
"'No... I don't think it's selfish at all.\\nI have a lot of fun living at\\nTsubaki Apartments too.'%K%P",
"I got so embarrassed seeing Inori looking up at me\\nbashfully, I had to turn away.%K%P",
"'Um, sh-shall we get started on cleaning?'%K%P",
"'Yes. The bamboo broom is over here.'%K%P",
"My face was still red when I started to clean.%K%P",
"'I'll clean around the main shrine.\\nCould you get the pathway?'%K%P",
"'Got it.'%K%P",
"'You can just gather the leaves near the front.'%K%P",
"'Okay, I'll start sweeping from the entrance.'%K%P",
"After I learned a few tips on how to use\\nthe bamboo broom, I started sweeping up\\nthe leaves from the entrance.%K%P",
"Hmm, using a bamboo broom is harder than\\nusing a regular one.%K%P",
"'Ah!'%K%P",
"'Inori?'%K%P",
"While I was trying my best to clean using the\\nunfamiliar bamboo broom, I heard a scream.%K%P",
"When I turned around to see what happened...%K%P",
"'Uhh...'%K%P",
"Somehow, Inori ended up being half-clothed.%K%P",
"'Um... Inori? What are you doing?'%K%P",
"'The leaves went in my clothes!\\nSee, I-I'm having a hard time\\ngetting them out... Eek!'%K%P",
"'Wha?!'%K%P",
"As Inori squirmed, her clothes were\\nslipping down little by little.%K%P",
"'I can't get them by myself. Sorry Sho, can you\\nhelp me?'%K%P",
"'H-Help you?!'%K%P",
"'Please. The leaves are itchy on my back\\nand it tickles.'%K%P",
"'I'll take my clothes off so it's easier...'%K%P",
"'Wait! Stop! Stop! You're fine just like that.\\nYou don't have to undress any further!'%K%P",
"'Are you sure? Okay.'%K%P",
"She stopped undressing as I requested,\\nbut she was still half-dressed.%K%P",
"Inori's exposed skin was flawless, I couldn't take\\nmy eyes off of it.%K%P",
"'S-So, where did the leaves go?'%K%P",
"'I'm pretty sure they're around the middle\\nof my back.'%K%P",
"I went behind her and swallowed my breath.\\nI was mesmerized by her beautiful nape.%K%P",
"D-Don't get any ideas.%K%P",
"Just focus on getting the leaves off of her.%K%P",
"'R-Right here?'%K%P",
"'Ah.'%K%P",
"I tried to avoid looking when I reached for Inori's\\nback, but I ended up touching her soft skin.%K%P",
"'Uhh... A little more to the right.'%K%P",
"D-Darn it. Inori's sensual voice was starting\\nto get to me.%K%P",
"'Oh, hmm... J-Just a little l-lower.'%K%P",
"'Inori, please, I beg you, stop making\\nthose sounds.'%K%P",
"'I-I'm doing m-my best. Oh...ah...'%K%P",
"Keep your cool, just keep your cool.%K%P",
"I was just trying to get the leaves out.\\nI wasn't doing anything weird.%K%P",
"'Mmm, mmm, ah, uh.'%K%P",
"'I-I found it! This is it.\\nI'll get it out now.\\nJust hang tight.'%K%P",
"'Oh...mm... That's ticklish...'%K%P",
"'Ah, ah...mm, hmm...'%K%P",
"'L-Look, Inori. I got it.'%K%P",
"'Th-Thank you so much... *Sigh*'%K%P",
"'Haha, don't worry about it...'%K%P",
"As I felt the exhaustion weighing down on me\\nat once, I went back to cleaning.%K%P",
"'Things are looking pretty good.'%K%P",
"We finished cleaning up the area.%K%P",
"'Yes. Let's call it a day and head home.'%K%P",
"'Oh, actually. Can I ask you something?'%K%P",
"'Is something the matter?'%K%P",
"I stopped Inori just as we were getting ready\\nto leave.%K%P",
"We came all this way to the shrine. It'd be a waste\\nto just go back home.%K%P",
"'May I go and worship for a little while?'%K%P",
"'Worship, really?'%K%P",
"'Yes. Would it bother you?'%K%P",
"'Not at all! It's just... I've never been told that\\nto my face before, so I got a little embarrassed.'%K%P",
"'This is a first for me too.\\nAnd I'm the one who'll be worshiping in front of\\nthe real goddess.'%K%P",
"We stood next to each other, facing the front\\nof the shrine.%K%P",
"'Here goes...'%K%P",
"I threw in my offering, rang the bell,\\nbowed twice, clapped twice,\\nand then bowed one last time.%K%P",
"'Sho, what did you wish for?'%K%P",
"'Would you like to know?'%K%P",
"'Only if you are willing to tell me.'%K%P",
"Seeing Inori's eyes beaming with high hopes,\\nthere was no choice but for me to tell.%K%P",
"'I wished for the successful completion\\nof your assignment.'%K%P",
"'Well, that's a very thoughtful wish of you, Sho.'%K%P",
"'Really? I thought it was a pretty normal one.'%K%P",
"'People usually make wishes for themselves.'%K%P",
"'But, that was the wish I wanted\\nto come true the most.\\nWas that bad...?'%K%P",
"'Of course not.\\nI can assure you that your wish will come true.\\nJust you wait and see.'%K%P",
"'I'm looking forward to it. Now that the sun's\\nsetting, shall we head back?'%K%P",
"'Yes. We don't want to be too late.'%K%P",
"We started walking side-by-side on the grounds\\nlit by the evening sun.%K%P",
"'Sho.'%K%P",
"'What is it?'%K%P",
"'Thank you for helping today.\\nLet's get back to\\nworking hard again tomorrow.'%K%P",
"The smile she gave me at that moment was the most\\nbeautiful one that day.%K%P"
