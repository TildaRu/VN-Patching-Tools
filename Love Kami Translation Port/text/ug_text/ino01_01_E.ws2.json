"After working with Inori and Maika to get Akane\\nfired up again, the passing days had been\\nso pleasant.%K%P",
"'That's it for today.'%K%P",
"I closed the book I was reading and stretched.%K%P",
"The book recommended to me by Inori was\\nunexpectedly good, time just zoomed passed.%K%P",
"'Better get some coffee.'%K%P",
"'Oh, Inori?'%K%P",
"'Sho?'%K%P",
"When I entered the living room,\\nInori looked serious, deep in thought.%K%P",
"'Did something happen?'%K%P",
"'Oh, well... I-It's nothing.'%K%P",
"She must have been thinking really hard\\nsince she didn't notice me until I spoke to her.%K%P",
"Because of that, she hurried to\\nput a smile on her face.%K%P",
"'Are you concerned about something?'%K%P",
"'There is something on my mind, but it's nothing\\nyou need to worry about, Sho.'%K%P",
"It was unusual for Inori to hide things like that.%K%P",
"It made me curious.%K%P",
"'Ah, seems like you don't trust me, Inori...\\nWhen I trust you so much.'%K%P",
"'What?! No, That's not true!\\nI trust you, Sho!'%K%P",
"'Then, tell me what's bothering you.'%K%P",
"'Oh, u-um...'%K%P",
"'See? You really don't...'%K%P",
"'O-Okay! I'll tell you!'%K%P",
"Whatever the situation, Inori was always nice.%K%P",
"'So, what's been bothering you?'%K%P",
"'Akane is very close to the people of\\nKannagi, right?'%K%P",
"'Hmm? Yeah, it sure seems like it.'%K%P",
"We'd been hearing stories during dinner\\nabout Akane's interactions with the people of\\nthe shopping street.%K%P",
"From what I heard, she had\\na very close relationship with them.%K%P",
"'After hearing those stories,\\nI can't help but to think this.'%K%P",
"'I am the goddess of Kannagi Town,\\nbut it's not like I'm close with\\nits people like Akane is.'%K%P",
"'That's why I was thinking of ways\\nto be more helpful for the people of Kannagi.'%K%P",
"After she released all her pent up feelings,\\nshe took a sip of her tea and let out a sigh.%K%P",
"'Do you feel contempt towards me\\nbeing jealous of Akane?'%K%P",
"'Why would I feel contempt?'%K%P",
"'You care so much about this town.\\nI admire that and will never feel\\ncontempt for you.'%K%P",
"'Sho...'%K%P",
"'From what you said, it sounds like you want\\nto be more involved with the people of this town.'%K%P",
"'Y-Yes. That's true.\\nBut, I just don't know what to do...'%K%P",
"'I'm not cheerful or assertive like Akane...'%K%P",
"'Hmm...'%K%P",
"A way to get closer to the townspeople...%K%P",
"Akane attracted them with her own,\\nunique personality.%K%P",
"It'd be cruel to make the modest\\nand virtuous Inori act like her.%K%P",
"Then, what was the best thing to do?%K%P",
"'Oh yeah...'%K%P",
"'Did you think of something?!'%K%P",
"Whoa, she's really serious about this.%K%P",
"Surprised to see Inori more active than usual,\\nI cleared my throat and stated my suggestion.%K%P",
"'It's actually very simple.\\nYou just have to make a regional contribution.'%K%P",
"'A regional contribution?'%K%P",
"Yes. You'll listen and solve the\\ntownspeople's concerns.\\nThat way, you'll naturally get closer to them.'%K%P",
"Inori made a distressed face upon hearing\\nmy suggestion.%K%P",
"'I appreciate the suggestion Sho, but unfortunately,\\nI cannot do that.'%K%P",
"'You can't?'%K%P",
"'Yes. Are you familiar with\\nthe Divine Fundamental Law?'%K%P",
"'Hmm, I'm not too familiar with it.'%K%P",
"'In short, it prohibits goddesses from making\\npeople's wishes come true. People are not allowed\\nto utilize goddesses like that.'%K%P",
"'I'd like to ask you to be aware of that.'%K%P",
"Hmm, that's interesting.%K%P",
"There's a high possibility to run into that issue\\nwith regional contribution.%K%P",
"'They're that strict about the\\nDivine Fundamental Law?'%K%P",
"'No, as long as I don't overdo it with my powers,\\nthere should be no problem.'%K%P",
"'There actually are goddesses\\nwho use Jinriki on a regular basis.%K%P",
"Oh?%K%P",
"Inori made it seem like it was a very\\nsevere regulation, but it seems like\\nit's actually not that extreme.%K%P",
"'Then there shouldn't be any issues, right?'%K%P",
"'Only if it's used 'normally'.'%K%P",
"'However, the goddess who's my superior is\\nvery strict on laws and regulations.'%K%P",
"'She is very hard to please and is very strict\\nwhen it comes to following them.'%K%P",
"Ah, it sounded like this goddess was the serious,\\nuptight type.%K%P",
"'Inori, it's not like you want to spread your name\\nas the goddess of this region, right?'%K%P",
"'Right. I'm not looking to be respected like that.\\nI just want all residents to be happy living here.'%K%P",
"'And if possible, I always want to see their smiles.\\nI believe that's how I should be as a goddess.'%K%P",
"'I see. Then you can help out as just Inori,\\nnot as the goddess Inori.'%K%P",
"'What?'%K%P",
"'Don't use Jinriki, don't spread the word\\nthat you're a goddess. Maybe they'd consider it\\nunder these conditions?'%K%P",
"'Th-That actually sounds possible. No, but...'%K%P",
"Inori kept mumbling as she digested the situation.%K%P",
"I was aware that I made an awful argument.%K%P",
"But I strongly felt that this was a great way for\\nInori to interact with the townspeople.%K%P",
"'I understand that your superior is strict, but\\nI think it's worth a try rather than\\ngiving up off the bat.'%K%P",
"'Heck, I'll even go with you to ask.'%K%P",
"'Sho... I got it. I'll give it a try.'%K%P",
"'I-It got approved.'%K%P",
"She muttered in surprise after she came back\\nfrom meeting with her boss.%K%P",
"'That's great.\\nNow you can go ahead with\\nhelping out the townspeople.'%K%P",
"'Yes! But, what should I do about\\nthe regional contribution...'%K%P",
"'I'm the one who suggested it.\\nSo let's come up with ideas together.'%K%P",
"I confidently said to reassure Inori.%K%P",
"'Yes! Let's think of a way together!'%K%P"
