"'Hey, Sho?'%K%P",
"'What's up, Mai-chan?'%K%P",
"'I saw this thing on TV the other day.\\nSometimes people who are really close\\ngo from being friends to being a couple.'%K%P",
"'Do you think we could be a couple someday?'%K%P",
"'Hm, I dunno. A couple's like a\\nmom and a dad, right?\\nCould we really become like that?'%K%P",
"'Aw, you don't want to?'%K%P",
"'Th-That's not it! Uh, how 'bout this?'%K%P",
"'When I'm grown up, and\\nbig and strong enough to\\ntake care of you--'%K%P",
"A few days had passed since Sho started running\\naround trying to restore Akane's motivation.%K%P",
"'Good! That's great, Akane!'%K%P",
"'Right? And just get a load of this!'%K%P",
"'Akane, I think something like this would work\\nbetter there.'%K%P",
"As usual, Sho and Inori were in the courtyard\\ncoaching Akane on her dance routine.%K%P",
"'You think so?'%K%P",
"'Yes. You see, this will be a little more showy...'%K%P",
"From my hidden vantage point I heaved a sigh.%K%P",
"Sho had thrown himself wholeheartedly\\ninto helping out Akane.%K%P",
"I couldn't tell how Akane felt, but she did\\nseem to be taking all this training seriously.%K%P",
"And Inori was always there to lend a hand.%K%P",
"As for me...\\nIt didn't feel like I was doing a lot.%K%P",
"Of course, I said I wanted to save this building\\nand that I'd do anything I could to help.%K%P",
"But none of it felt real.%K%P",
"'What can I do...?'%K%P",
"I was at a loss.%K%P",
"I'd been putting up a front for so long. I didn't\\neven know how I truly felt anymore.%K%P",
"'What do I want, really...?'%K%P",
"Did I want to save Tsubaki Apartments,\\nor just let it go?%K%P",
"I muttered to myself softly so that no one else\\ncould hear.%K%P",
"'You're going to see your boss?'%K%P",
"'Yes. I received a call from her asking both Akane\\nand I to come discuss matters in person.'%K%P",
"It wasn't until morning practice was over and\\nwe'd finished lunch, that Inori brought it up.%K%P",
"'Sounds boooring, do I really have to go?'%K%P",
"'Yes, you do. It may be boring,\\nbut it's also important.'%K%P",
"'Fine, fine, I'll go, I'll go.'%K%P",
"'Once is enough.\\nIn any case... Sho, Maika?'%K%P",
"'I'm afraid Akane and I will be leaving now.'%K%P",
"'What?!'%K%P",
"'Huh? Something wrong, Maika?'%K%P",
"'Oh, uh, it's nothing...\\nSo you're leaving me\\nalone with Sho?'%K%P",
"She muttered something under her breath,\\nbut I let it go.%K%P",
"'Will you be staying for dinner?'%K%P",
"'I'm not sure. We could be back by evening...\\nIf nothing goes wrong, that is.'%K%P",
"'Why are you looking at me?\\nAre you suggesting I'll do something\\nto mess it up?!'%K%P",
"'Yes, something like flying off the handle at our\\nboss...'%K%P",
"'You get angry way more than I do.'%K%P",
"'Did you say something?'%K%P",
"'No, nothing...'%K%P",
"'This being the case, we may be away overnight.'%K%P",
"'Urgh, this sucks!\\nI want to eat Maika's cooking!'%K%P",
"Akane began to sulk.%K%P",
"'How about we make something you can\\nreheat when you get back?'%K%P",
"'Oh, thank you. That would be great.'%K%P",
"'If you truly want to get home early, be sure to\\ntake this meeting seriously.'%K%P",
"'Urrrgh... Okay, fine.'%K%P",
"With a reluctant nod, Akane followed after Inori\\nand they both left the building.%K%P",
"With the two of them gone, it seemed\\nawfully quiet.%K%P",
"They'd been here so long the place felt\\nempty without them.%K%P",
"'What should we make for dinner...?\\nHow about curry!'%K%P",
"'...'%K%P",
"'Maika?'%K%P",
"'Huh? What?'%K%P",
"'What about dinner?\\nWe need to make something\\nthat's easy to reheat.'%K%P",
"'Anything's good, right?\\nWhy would we need to reheat it?'%K%P",
"'Were you even listening to Inori?'%K%P",
"'Oh... Yeah, sorry.\\nI was just...thinking.'%K%P",
"'Something on your mind?\\nDo you want to talk about it?'%K%P",
"'N-No, it's nothing serious. I'm fine, really.'%K%P",
"She didn't sound fine. She'd been acting strange\\nfor a little while now.%K%P",
"'So, what was the problem about Inori?'%K%P",
"'She and Akane have to meet with their boss,\\nthey might be home late. So I thought we'd\\nmake dinner for when they get back.'%K%P",
"'Okay, sounds good.'%K%P",
"Maika still sounded distracted, like her mind was\\nsomewhere else.%K%P",
"'You sure you're all right?\\nYou can go take a nap or\\nsomething if you like.'%K%P",
"'I'm fine. Besides, I've got chores to take care of.'%K%P",
"'Let me help you with that, then.'%K%P",
"Maika had already got up and was halfway\\nto the door.%K%P",
"'It's okay. You should rest.\\nYou must be tired from helping Akane\\nwith her practice every day.'%K%P",
"'There's no way I can relax at a time like this.\\nBesides, the housework'll get done faster\\nwith two of us, right?'%K%P",
"'I guess...'%K%P",
"'Then it's settled.\\nI'll wash up the breakfast stuff if you can handle\\nthings out here. Sound good?'%K%P",
"'Sure.'%K%P",
"'Great. Let's get started.'%K%P",
"I flexed my arms a little and headed for the kitchen.%K%P",
"When I finished up in there, I went looking for Maika\\nto see if she needed help with anything else.%K%P",
"There was something odd about her today.%K%P",
"'She seemed fine at breakfast, but now...\\nIs she sick or something?'%K%P",
"I had no idea.%K%P",
"Asking her directly wouldn't get me anywhere.\\nIt still bothered me, though.%K%P",
"'Oh, here you are.'%K%P",
"'You're done already? That was fast.'%K%P",
"'There wasn't that much to do.\\nLooks like you're almost finished, too.'%K%P",
"'Yeah, almost.\\nYou can head on ba--'%K%P",
"'No, I can still work. Here, give me a cloth.'%K%P",
"'Okay...'%K%P",
"I took one of Maika's spare cleaning\\ncloths and stood next to her, wiping down\\nany areas she'd missed.%K%P",
"'I guess you can't reach up here, huh?'%K%P",
"'Yeah, but...you really don't have to help\\nlike this, you know.'%K%P",
"'I want to. I've been spending so much time\\nwith Akane and Inori lately, it's nice to be able\\nto do something for you.'%K%P",
"'Oh really? And what would you do for me?'%K%P",
"'For you, anything!'%K%P",
"'Jeez, enough with the cheesy lines.'%K%P",
"Maika smiled.%K%P",
"She was acting a little more like herself now.%K%P",
"'This is...kinda strange, huh?'%K%P",
"'What is?'%K%P",
"'It's been a while since you and I have been\\nalone together.'%K%P",
"'Up until a while ago it was always just\\nthe two of us here, but now it feels weird\\nwithout Akane and Inori around.'%K%P",
"'I'm not saying it's a bad thing. Just...'%K%P",
"'Just...?'%K%P",
"'Forget it. It's nothing.'%K%P",
"What had she been trying to say?%K%P",
"I could only guess she was struggling with\\nsomething she couldn't put into words.%K%P",
"'Hey Maika.\\nAre you sure you're okay?'%K%P",
"'Of course I am. Why wouldn't I be?'%K%P",
"'You're lying.'%K%P",
"I looked straight into Maika's eyes.%K%P",
"'What makes you say that?'%K%P",
"She turned away to avoid my gaze. But I knew.%K%P",
"'How long have we known each other?\\nBy now I can at least tell\\nwhen you're not being honest.'%K%P",
"'...'%K%P",
"She didn't say a word.%K%P",
"But in a way, that silence was answer enough for me.%K%P",
"'You know I'll do anything I can\\nto help, right?'%K%P",
"'Thanks. But really, it's nothing.'%K%P",
"'If you say so...'%K%P",
"It wouldn't do any good to try to pressure\\nMaika into saying more.%K%P",
"I knew that, but I still wished I could do something.%K%P",
"'This isn't something I can tell you...'%K%P",
"'What was that?'%K%P",
"'I said enough chatter!\\nIf you're gonna work,\\nthen get to work!'%K%P",
"'Yes ma'am!'%K%P",
"Maika's expression was a perfect mask.\\nIt could have meant anything.%K%P",
"I'd just have to wait until she was ready to talk.%K%P"
