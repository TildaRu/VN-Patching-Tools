"Inori and Maika headed out to enjoy their day. Akane,\\non the other hand, was spaced out in the living room.%K%P",
"'Akane, you're not doing anything?'%K%P",
"'I want to do something,\\nbut I can't make up my mind.\\nIt's been so long since my last day off.'%K%P",
"'What are you doing, Sho?'%K%P",
"'Me? Nothing in particular. I'm just going to relax\\nand read in my room.'%K%P",
"'I'm impressed that you read.\\nI start to get sleepy when I do...\\nOh yeah...'%K%P",
"'Hey Sho. If you're just gonna stay at home and read,\\nwhy don't you come and hang out with me?'%K%P",
"'Hang out?'%K%P",
"'Yup! If you're free, let's go!'%K%P",
"When I thought about it, I'd never gone out with\\nAkane alone before.%K%P",
"'Yup, I'm free, so let's go.'%K%P",
"'All right! Good answer Sho!\\nYou know what's up!'%K%P",
"When she got all excited about going out like that,\\nit excited me too.%K%P",
"Especially since Akane had always been sincere.%K%P",
"'So, where are we going?'%K%P",
"'Nowhere in particular! I'm sure we'll figure it out \\non the way!'%K%P",
"'No plans, huh?\\nSpontaneity is good once in a while.'%K%P",
"'Right? Let's not waste any more time!\\nHurry, hurry!'%K%P",
"'Okay, okay.\\nI'll go wherever you want,\\nyou don't have to pull me like that.'%K%P",
"We left Tsubaki Apartments, as Akane pulled my\\nhand with excitement.%K%P",
"'Here we are!'%K%P",
"As we walked aimlessly around Kannagi,\\nwe arrived at the familiar shopping street.%K%P",
"'Well, this is the shopping street.'%K%P",
"It was only natural to get to the liveliest shopping\\ndistrict of Kannagi.%K%P",
"'Akane, do you come here often?'%K%P",
"'I do. Before I lived at the apartments,\\nI used to come here a lot.'%K%P",
"'We might've crossed paths here before.'%K%P",
"'Possibly. But how could I forget passing by a\\ngoddess like you?'%K%P",
"'Well, I am a beautiful girl.'%K%P",
"While it sounded a bit conceited, the fact that\\nAkane is a beautiful girl was undeniably true.%K%P",
"'It's true. You're this cute and also a goddess on\\ntop of that. I'd say that's pretty impressive.'%K%P",
"'Uh... It's not fair for you to say that to my face.'%K%P",
"'Not fair?'%K%P",
"'W-Well, I didn't expect to hear\\nthose words from you.\\nI was surprised.'%K%P",
"It was obvious that Akane was blushing even though\\nshe was looking down.%K%P",
"Even Akane blushes like that.%K%P",
"'Akane, you're really cute right now.\\nYup, you're more beautiful\\nthan any other idol out there.'%K%P",
"'Uh...stop, don't do this now...'%K%P",
"The more I complimented Akane, the more\\nshe curled up.%K%P",
"It was refreshing to see her tear up since she's\\nthe one who usually jokes like this.\\nThis was my chance to tease her back.%K%P",
"'H-Hey! Don't pet me! Stop!'%K%P",
"As I silently petted Akane's head, she curled up\\neven more.%K%P",
"'Sorry. Did you not like that?'%K%P",
"'W-Well... It's not like I didn't...'%K%P",
"'Akane?'%K%P",
"'N-Never mind! Let's go already!'%K%P",
"Akane was still blushing as she pulled me through\\nthe shopping street.%K%P",
"'Is that you, Akane?'%K%P",
"'Hello ma'am!'%K%P",
"The meat shop lady stepped out of the shop to\\ngreet her.%K%P",
"'It's been a while, Akane. I was worried because I\\nhaven't seen you around lately. How have you been?'%K%P",
"'As you can see, I've been good!'%K%P",
"'Hello. It's good to see you.'%K%P",
"'Oh? Sho's with you today too.'%K%P",
"'Yup! I was hoping he'd treat me to something!'%K%P",
"'My, my, is this a date? There's more to both of you\\nthan meets the eye.'%K%P",
"'What?! Y-You're mistaken.\\nIt's not like that at all!'%K%P",
"'Huh? I was totally fine with this being a date.'%K%P",
"Akane looked over as she teased me.%K%P",
"She's trying to get even with me from earlier.%K%P",
"'It's really not like that.\\nAkane, I'm sorry about what happened earlier.\\nPlease forgive me.'%K%P",
"'Hmm, all right.\\nYou seem sorry about it.'%K%P",
"'Ma'am, I was only kidding.\\nSho and I are just hanging out\\nas friends.'%K%P",
"'Oh my.\\nForgive me for misunderstanding.'%K%P",
"The lady smiled with her hand over her mouth.%K%P",
"She didn't believe us at all.%K%P",
"'Oh, since you're here, have some croquettes.'%K%P",
"The lady went back into the shop and came back\\nwith two croquettes wrapped in oil-proof paper.%K%P",
"'Really? Are you sure?'%K%P",
"'Of course, for troubling you.'%K%P",
"'All right, thanks Ma'am!'%K%P",
"'You're very generous. Thank you very much.'%K%P",
"'Oh, of course.\\nJust be careful, it's still hot.'%K%P",
"'Yes, will d--'%K%P",
"'Ouch!'%K%P",
"Akane took a bite before the warning and her eyes\\nteared up because it was hot.%K%P",
"'Akane, you always eat too fast.\\nAre you all right?'%K%P",
"'H-Hah, ah, hah, I-I'm all right.'%K%P",
"'Did you burn yourself? Do you want me to go get a\\ncold drink?'%K%P",
"'I-I'll b-be okay...'%K%P",
"'Are you sure? Let me see.'%K%P",
"'What?! Um, well that's...'%K%P",
"'If you don't take care of it now, you're the one\\nwho's gonna be in pain later.'%K%P",
"'Augh. O-Okay... Here.'%K%P",
"I got the teary-eyed Akane to stick out her tongue.%K%P",
"I tilted her chin up and saw that her tongue\\nwas just a little red.%K%P",
"'It's a little red. Does it still hurt?'%K%P",
"'I-It stings but I'm okay.\\nB-But Sho, this looks a little...'%K%P",
"'Looks a little... Oh.'%K%P",
"Akane was bashful since I was looking at her with\\nher face tilted up.%K%P",
"From a certain angle, it looked like we were\\nabout to kiss.%K%P",
"'Y-You're quite bold today, Sho.\\nY-You keep topping me.'%K%P",
"'You're wrong! That wasn't my intention!\\nHuh?!'%K%P",
"I turned around to find that the lady was\\nsmiling at us.%K%P",
"'Oh, I'm sorry. Did I disrupt you?'%K%P",
"'N-No! This is a misunderstanding!\\nPlease understand!'%K%P",
"I tried explaining to the lady who\\nstepped back inside the shop.\\nDid she believe me...?%K%P",
"Probably not.%K%P",
"After the meat shop fiasco, we continued to look\\naround the shopping street.%K%P",
"As I accompanied Akane, I discovered that she\\nwas popular around here.%K%P",
"Every time we stepped into a place, she would\\nencounter someone she knew.%K%P",
"It was safe to say that she knew everyone here.%K%P",
"'Akane, you seem pretty close with the people here.'%K%P",
"'What? Really?'%K%P",
"Akane just stared, looking puzzled.%K%P",
"She wasn't aware of it at all.%K%P",
"'Lots of people talked to you.'%K%P",
"'Hmm? Isn't that normal?'%K%P",
"'It wouldn't be like that unless you were\\nclose to them.'%K%P",
"'Really? But it's normal for me, so I don't really\\nget what you mean.'%K%P",
"I was stunned. This was all normal for Akane.%K%P",
"'Well, not everyone has the ability to do that.'%K%P",
"When I met her for the first time, I was able to\\nopen up to her pretty quickly as well.%K%P",
"I think people are attracted to Akane's sincere\\nand caring personality.%K%P",
"'I see. So, do I seem like a goddess?'%K%P",
"'Yup. I'm convinced that you're an\\nincredible goddess.'%K%P",
"'Hmm, right? I am an amazing goddess indeed.'%K%P",
"Akane dashed in front of me to try to show me\\nhow proud she was.%K%P",
"'Hey, stop! If you rush out like that...'%K%P",
"'Wha--? Ah!!'%K%P",
"'C-Cold...'%K%P",
"'Ohhh, I'm sorry. You appeared all of a sudden...'%K%P",
"Carried away, Akane didn't look where she was going\\nand ran into the area where a lady was throwing out\\nsome water.%K%P",
"'Uhh... I'm soaked, jeez.'%K%P",
"'Told you...\\nAre you hurt?'%K%P",
"'Nope. My clothes just got wet.'%K%P",
"'Okay, good. Just be careful next time.'%K%P",
"Akane's clothes were dripping wet from the water.%K%P",
"'I-I know. Augh, it's clinging to my skin\\nand it feels gross...'%K%P",
"Anyway, she sure did get soaked.%K%P",
"Her clothes absorbed the water and clung\\non to her skin.%K%P",
"Because of it, not only her underwear,\\nbut also the shape of her breasts\\nwere exposed by her wet clothes.%K%P",
"'Since it's still hot, I thought I'd be okay, but the\\nwind feels colder than I thought.'%K%P",
"Akane was cold and shivering.%K%P",
"With her clothes clinging on like that, I saw her\\nbig breasts swaying.%K%P",
"'Y-Yeah. Let's go home so you can take a bath.'%K%P",
"Oh no.%K%P",
"This is extremely bad.%K%P",
"To avoid looking at Akane, I intentionally\\nfaced forward.%K%P",
"'Hey, Sho. Are you thinking of lewd things\\nright now?'%K%P",
"'That's just your imagination.'%K%P",
"As if Akane was a cat who discovered her prey,\\nshe didn't pass up the chance\\nto draw closer to me.%K%P",
"'You're not imagining things by looking at my\\nunderwear showing through?'%K%P",
"'Of course not. I'm totally in my...normal state.'%K%P",
"'Hmm, are you sure?\\nIf you're honest, I could let you\\nlook a little?'%K%P",
"'That's not necessary.'%K%P",
"I really wanted to look.%K%P",
"Of course I'd love to see a cute girl in her\\nunderwear, but if I got lured into this trap,\\nI know she'd tease me for a while.%K%P",
"I needed to restrain myself, no matter what...%K%P",
"'You're resisting it. But, how about...this?!'%K%P",
"'Whoa! D-Don't cling to me, I'll get wet!'%K%P",
"'See? How about that?\\nJust be true to yourself, come on.'%K%P",
"O-Oh no.%K%P",
"Taking my arm and tucking it into that soft,\\nsupple area was against the rules.%K%P",
"'So? Do you give up?'%K%P",
"'Of course not! J-Just get away from me!'%K%P",
"But I couldn't help but look where my arm\\nwas touching.%K%P",
"'Ahaha, but your eyes speak the truth.\\nYup, you're a boy after all.'%K%P",
"'Uh...'%K%P",
"I couldn't say anything since it was true.%K%P",
"'Well, now that I've seen you vexed, I'm done\\ntaking revenge on you for today.'%K%P",
"Akane finally separated from me.\\nShe must've vented everything out.%K%P",
"With the texture of her soft breasts gone, I felt\\ndisappointed, yet relieved.%K%P",
"At least it didn't get to a point where I lost\\nmy senses.%K%P",
"'Jeez... But you've changed.'%K%P",
"'How so?'%K%P",
"'You didn't get mad when you got water\\nsplashed on you. You would've been furious\\nback then.'%K%P",
"'Hmm, really? I don't really know.'%K%P",
"She was unaware of it, but I was happy to see the\\ngradual results of her rehabilitation.%K%P",
"'Keep up the good work.'%K%P",
"'I'm gonna work hard to become an idol.'%K%P",
"'Yeah, that's the spirit.'%K%P",
"'Oh, hey! Don't pet me! Sho!'%K%P",
"'Come on, just let me.'%K%P",
"'Hmph...'%K%P",
"As she bashfully looked the other way,\\nwe started to head back home.%K%P",
"Because we went out together, I got to see\\nmore sides of Akane.%K%P",
"Every time I saw a new side of hers, I felt closer\\nto her, which made me happy.%K%P",
"As I saw how the rehabilitation was working, I was\\nencouraged to see how Akane's efforts were\\npaying off.%K%P"
