  "'So, in the end, what did Sara say?'%K%P",
  "'She said that she'd decided to retire a long\\ntime ago. That was actually how the whole plan\\nfor the audition started.'%K%P",
  "Sara hadn't told Shuri the real truth.%K%P",
  "That was probably best.\\nIf she'd told Shuri that she couldn't sing any more,\\nShuri likely wouldn't have been able to focus\\non the audition.%K%P",
  "'But she should have told us!\\nShe can be so distant sometimes.'%K%P",
  "'I understand how you feel, but I bet\\nshe couldn't have told us, even if she wanted.\\nI mean, they've got NDAs and all that stuff.'%K%P",
  "'Ohhh, I see...'%K%P",
  "For the time being, it looked like they both\\naccepted the situation.%K%P",
  "'Okay you two, let's get focused\\non the final audition.'%K%P",
  "Since we'd gotten past the Sara situation,\\nit was time to face the final audition.%K%P",
  "The audition was in a month,\\nand we were meeting to plan out how to handle it.%K%P",
  "'I guess it's time to break up the group, isn't it?'%K%P",
  "'Nooo! I don't want to do that!'%K%P",
  "'But now we're in direct competition, aren't we?\\nI mean, in the end there can be only one, right?'%K%P",
  "'Yeah, but... I like performing with you, Shuri...'%K%P",
  "'Oh, that's so sweet of you...\\nI mean, I want to stay in Love☆Kami, too...'%K%P",
  "'But we can't. We have to be serious about this.'%K%P",
  "'There's no need to break it off\\nfor good or anything. Once the audition's over,\\nyou can get back together.'%K%P",
  "'Yamato's right.\\nSo Love☆Kami is just going on a temporary hiatus.'%K%P",
  "'Well, if that's the case,\\nI guess I can handle it...'%K%P",
  "It looked like Kagura more or less agreed,\\nso I thought the problem had been solved.%K%P",
  "'But, what are you going to do after this, Yamato?'%K%P",
  "If the two of them were going forward on their own,\\nmy role would become kind of complicated.%K%P",
  "'Well, if it's possible,\\nI'd like to keep working with him...'%K%P",
  "'Me too. I have no idea what to do on my own!'%K%P",
  "They had both been on their own,\\nand experienced the struggle.%K%P",
  "To suddenly go back to that after being\\npart of a trio like this must have been scary.%K%P",
  "'I still think the three of us should stay together!'%K%P",
  "'But then nothing will change, will it?'%K%P",
  "The audition would put them into direct competition,\\nso the three of us continuing like we always had\\njust would not work.%K%P",
  "I was sure Kagura understood it in her head,\\nher heart just hadn't caught up.%K%P",
  "'Okay then, how about alternating days?'%K%P",
  "'But then we'll know exactly what the other's doing.'%K%P",
  "'I'm okay with that.\\nI don't have anything to hide from you.'%K%P",
  "'Maybe you're okay with it, but I'm not!'%K%P",
  "It looked like Shuri had some kind of plan.%K%P",
  "Whatever the case, it would be important to\\nkeep their ideas secret from each other.%K%P",
  "'And anyway, I want to compete\\nhead to head with you, Kagura.'%K%P",
  "'Ever since we formed our duo,\\nI always thought you were so amazing.\\nYou have so much more appeal than I do.'%K%P",
  "'Oh, but... Shuri, you're amazing too!\\nYou're a great singer, and you're so smart.'%K%P",
  "'But you're so much better at dancing.\\nAnd you're so likable,\\nthat's a really strong point...'%K%P",
  "'With all of that, I think you make\\na really worthy opponent.'%K%P",
  "'And so this time, I want to step back and\\ngive everything I've got to compete with you.'%K%P",
  "It was precisely because they had become so close\\nthat she wanted to have a real competition.%K%P",
  "Shuri's passionate words seemed to\\nlight a fire in Kagura, as well.%K%P",
  "'All right, Shuri, it's on!'%K%P",
  "'I'm counting on you.\\nShow me what you're made of!'%K%P",
  "Shuri and Kagura were already throwing off sparks.%K%P",
  "It looked like I could relax a bit.%K%P",
  "'Well then, I guess I'll step back and\\nwatch from a distance.'%K%P",
  "'If I helped either one of you,\\nit wouldn't be a fair fight, would it?'%K%P",
  "'I guess you're right...'%K%P",
  "'But... Are you okay with that, Yamato?\\nLove☆Kami isn't just the two of us, it's a trio.'%K%P",
  "'Well, I appreciate you saying that,\\nbut in the end I'm just your support.%K%P",
  "If you two are really going head-to-head,\\nI think it's fine if I bow out for a while.'%K%P",
  "'Yamato has said what he wants.\\nListen to him.'%K%P",
  "'Right... I understand.'%K%P",
  "I would be lying if I said it didn't feel lonely.%K%P",
  "All three of us had worked so hard,\\nbut at the end of it all,\\nI would be the only one to leave.%K%P",
  "I had this feeling of emptiness,\\nlike I didn't know why I'd done it all.%K%P",
  "When I thought about it more,\\nof course, it hadn't been for me, but for these two.%K%P",
  "And so for their sakes, I would stay out of\\nthe final auditions.%K%P",
  "Nothing would actually change for me.\\nMy position was still exactly the same.%K%P",
  "That was what was best for Love☆Kami.%K%P"
