  "'It's almost time...'%K%P",
  "I was talking to myself as I checked my watch.%K%P",
  "Kagura had begged me to go on a date right away,\\nso we were supposed to meet up after school.%K%P",
  "It was almost time, but she still wasn't there.%K%P",
  "'Ahh!'%K%P",
  "'Ahh?!'%K%P",
  "A pain suddenly ran through my body.%K%P",
  "Through my hip, to be exact...\\nI looked around in a panic.%K%P",
  "'Hehe, did I keep you waiting?'%K%P",
  "'Geez Kagura, don't surprise me like that...'%K%P",
  "'I just figured it'd be more fun that way.'%K%P",
  "'Nope, I would have to disagree.'%K%P",
  "'Really? You sure?'%K%P",
  "'Just, take it easy next time, okay?'%K%P",
  "'Okay!'%K%P",
  "She responded quite cheerily.%K%P",
  "Was she really even listening?\\nJudging by the look on her face I'd say no.%K%P",
  "'Well anyway, Akiba is as packed as always, huh?\\nPeople and goddesses everywhere.'%K%P",
  "'I probably won't stand out all that much\\nin a crowd like this, huh?'%K%P",
  "She said it with a smile on her face.\\nBut she couldn't have been more wrong.%K%P",
  "Akiba may have been filled with goddesses,\\nbut she still drew a lot of attention.%K%P",
  "'No, I think you still stand out quite a bit.'%K%P",
  "'Really?'%K%P",
  "'Yup. You're just too adorable.'%K%P",
  "'Oh...'%K%P",
  "'Um...'%K%P",
  "Shoot. There I go again.\\nJust speaking without thinking.%K%P",
  "'Hehehe, thanks.\\nYou sure know how to make a girl smile!'%K%P",
  "'Oh, I... No, it's just...\\nLots of people out here today, huh? Ahaha!'%K%P",
  "'Don't try to hide it!'%K%P",
  "She latched on to my arm as she spoke.%K%P",
  "And as she did, her busty bosom\\npressed into my elbow.%K%P",
  "'H-Hey, your chest is...'%K%P",
  "'Special service!\\nDon't you like it?' *Squish squish*%K%P",
  "She looked like she was having fun\\nrubbing her goods on me.%K%P",
  "If I had to say whether I liked it or not,\\nI'd have to say yes!%K%P",
  "'Anyway, now that you've had your special service,\\nshall we get going?'%K%P",
  "'Hey, don't pull.'%K%P",
  "'Come on come on, let's go!'%K%P",
  "She vigorously tugged at my arm,\\nexcited to get going.%K%P",
  "And so it was that our first date got off\\nto an exciting sort of start.%K%P",
  "'Are you sure you just want to go to\\nAkiba, though?'%K%P",
  "'Huh, what do you mean?'%K%P",
  "'For our date.\\nYou sure you didn't want to go somewhere else?'%K%P",
  "We could have gone to a theme park, the movies...%K%P",
  "Akiba wasn't a bad place,\\nbut it wasn't exactly a great date spot.%K%P",
  "'Oh, no, don't worry about that.\\nAkiba works out well.'%K%P",
  "'Actually, it just HAD to be Akiba\\nfor our date today.'%K%P",
  "'Wait, what do you mean?'%K%P",
  "'Ahahaha, don't worry about it.\\nJust a personal thing.'%K%P",
  "'Anyway, we're finally on a date.\\nLet's enjoy it, 'kay?'%K%P",
  "'Alright, fine.'%K%P",
  "This date was her idea anyway.%K%P",
  "This was all for her,\\nso the details didn't really matter.%K%P",
  "'Oh, hey! Look at that!\\nThere's a maid giving out flyers!'%K%P",
  "'You're right!\\nBut... That's not really all that uncommon.'%K%P",
  "In fact, here in Akiba at least,\\nit was more common than anything.%K%P",
  "I guess it would be something exciting\\njust about anywhere else, though.%K%P",
  "That fact that we have goddesses wandering around\\nseemed infinitely more incredible.%K%P",
  "'I wonder what maid cafe she works at?\\nOr maybe she's actually a goddess?'%K%P",
  "'Hmm, who knows?'%K%P",
  "'Hey, Yamato,\\nyou like places like that, don't you?'%K%P",
  "'Hold on a sec, when did I ever say that?'%K%P",
  "'But the first time we both met was at a\\ngoddess cafe, wasn't it?'%K%P",
  "'Oh yeah, I guess you're right.'%K%P",
  "I had just finished up some errands that day,\\nsaw Shuri performing on the street and\\nfound myself taking interest...%K%P",
  "Then I saw that there was a cafe\\nputting on live shows, so I decided to check it out.%K%P",
  "'That was all quite the shock.'%K%P",
  "'Why? Was I just too charming\\nfor you to handle?' %K%P",
  "'No, it was just that all of a sudden you started\\nstripping down on stage.'%K%P",
  "'Ahaha, yeah, that's right!'%K%P",
  "'I don't think it's something to just laugh about.'%K%P",
  "'Let's just make sure that you don't start stripping\\nduring the final audition, okay?'%K%P",
  "'Yeah yeah, I know.\\nYou sure like to worry.'%K%P",
  "I was pretty sure she would be okay, but still,\\nshe had a tendency to undress when excited.%K%P",
  "'Don't worry, the only person who will get\\nto see me naked now is you!'%K%P",
  "'You do know that's not\\nwhat I'm worried about here, right?'%K%P",
  "'Wait, so you mean, you don't mind if\\nother people see me naked, then?'%K%P",
  "'No no no...'%K%P",
  "'See? Don't try and cover it up.'%K%P",
  "She latched on to my arm again as she spoke.%K%P",
  "Looking at the smile she had on her face,\\nI couldn't say any more.%K%P",
  "'It really feels like that whole thing was\\nso long ago, though.'%K%P",
  "'Yeah. We've been through a lot, huh.'%K%P",
  "Kagura and Shuri had teamed up just because of\\nsome random idea I'd had.%K%P",
  "We'd had our share of bumps along the way,\\nbut hard work got us through the preliminaries.%K%P",
  "And now here we were,\\njust one day before the final audition.%K%P",
  "'I wasn't sure what to do when you checked\\nthe online rankings and said you'd drop out.'%K%P",
  "'Oh, haha, sorry about that.'%K%P",
  "'No, no, I'm not mad.\\nBut it's a good thing you kept at it, right?'%K%P",
  "'Yeah, seriously. You were right.'%K%P",
  "I thought back on everything we had done so far.%K%P",
  "We'd put a lot of effort into our online activities,\\nand had ended up with tons more fans.%K%P",
  "People weren't posting saying how she was just\\ndimwitted eye-candy or anything anymore.%K%P",
  "Now they just talked about how incredibly cool\\nshe was and how sexy her dancing was.%K%P",
  "Still though,\\nwe wanted a bit more than just that.%K%P",
  "'Not much time left until auditions are over.'%K%P",
  "She muttered to herself,\\nit seemed we were thinking the same thing.%K%P",
  "'You nervous?'%K%P",
  "'Hmm... I guess I'd be lying if I said I wasn't.\\nBut I've just gotta do my best.'%K%P",
  "She started to smile again.%K%P",
  "I knew she had to be feeling the pressure\\nat least a bit.%K%P",
  "After spending all this time with her, I saw how\\nhumans and goddesses were alike in those ways.%K%P",
  "'I know it doesn't sound like much,\\nbut I believe in you, Kagura.'%K%P",
  "'Thanks, Yamato.'%K%P",
  "I really wished I had something better\\nto say to her.%K%P",
  "I was really upset with myself for not\\nfinding the right words.%K%P",
  "I just wanted to say something, anything,\\nthat would boost her morale...%K%P",
  "'Um, excuse me!'%K%P",
  "'Yes?'%K%P",
  "'Sorry if I'm wrong, but,\\nAre you... Kagura?'%K%P",
  "Some girl came up to us out of the blue,\\nlooking quite nervous.%K%P",
  "But Kagura seemed to think nothing of it.%K%P",
  "'Huh? Me? Yes, that's right.'%K%P",
  "'Wow, really?!'%K%P",
  "Why was this girl coming up to her like this?%K%P",
  "Had she seen Kagura's stuff online\\nor during the auditions or something?%K%P",
  "'Um, well...'%K%P",
  "She looked like she was struggling to speak.%K%P",
  "Hold on, was this girl going to try to criticize\\nKagura's performances?%K%P",
  "'Well, you see!'%K%P",
  "'Hey...'%K%P",
  "'I'm a huuuge fan!!'%K%P",
  "'Huh?'%K%P",
  "'Really? Oh, that's wonderful!'%K%P",
  "'Can I shake your hand?'%K%P",
  "'Of course! Here...'%K%P",
  "'Wow! Thank you so much!'%K%P",
  "Kagura offered out her hand and the girl\\nshook it with vigor.%K%P",
  "I guess I had just been imagining things.%K%P",
  "'I'm going to be voting for you in the auditions,\\nso good luck!'%K%P",
  "'Aww, thanks. I really appreciate it!'%K%P",
  "'Anyway, sorry for calling out to you\\nall of a sudden.'%K%P",
  "She seemed quite excited as she said this,\\nnodded in apology again, and made her way off.%K%P",
  "'Well look at you,\\nso famous you're getting noticed on the streets.'%K%P",
  "'Hehehe, it's no big deal.\\nJust a coincidence.'%K%P",
  "'Still, I'm kind of glad to know that I have\\nsome girl fans, too.'%K%P",
  "What had I been worried about...?\\nShe seemed super pleased.%K%P",
  "I should have expected no less from a goddess.\\nBut, it was Kagura after all.%K%P",
  "'Hey, wait, is that Kagura?\\nOver there!'%K%P",
  "'Kagura? Who's that?'%K%P",
  "'Oh come on, she's one of the Lâ˜†SEVEN audition\\nfinalists.'%K%P",
  "'Oh, the sexy one?'%K%P",
  "'Watch your mouth! Yeah, sure, she is pretty sexy,\\nbut she's more than that, okay?!' %K%P",
  "'She's a great dancer,\\nand even a great singer lately!'%K%P",
  "'Geez, alright already. No need to yell.'%K%P",
  "A couple of boys nearby us seemed to be\\nquite excited over something.%K%P",
  "'Hey, you think those people over there\\nare your fans, too?'%K%P",
  "'If I had to guess, yeah.'%K%P",
  "'What should we do? Should we say something?'%K%P",
  "'If you like her that much, go for it.'%K%P",
  "'But wouldn't it be bad to\\nbother her on her time off?'%K%P",
  "'Hey, don't ask me.'%K%P",
  "'Hey, you guys.'%K%P",
  "'WHAT?! Did she just talk to US?!'%K%P",
  "'What the?! Wh-What should we do?'%K%P",
  "'Hey, why are you getting all panicked, too?'%K%P",
  "'B-Because I'm secretly a huge fan too!'%K%P",
  "'Are you kidding me?!'%K%P",
  "'Hey, you boys wouldn't happen to be fans of mine,\\nwould you?'%K%P",
  "'Oh, um, y-y-y-es!'%K%P",
  "'I always watch your dance videos\\nwhenever they're posted online.'%K%P",
  "'Oh. Thanks.\\nIt's okay to relax now, you know.'%K%P",
  "That was certainly out of the question.%K%P",
  "Any idol fan would be beside themselves if the\\nidol they adored suddenly approached them.%K%P",
  "But that was one of the great things about Kagura,\\nshe always acted so normal despite it all.%K%P",
  "'Could we uhh... Ask for your signature?'%K%P",
  "'Of course. Do you have something I could sign with?'%K%P",
  "'Oh, yeah, I have a marker.'%K%P",
  "'Nice! Could you sign this shirt??'%K%P",
  "'Mine too!'%K%P",
  "'Okay okay, let's take turns now.'%K%P",
  "Kagura took her time,\\nand signed their t-shirts in order.%K%P",
  "They seemed beyond pleased and continued thanking\\nher again and again before taking off.%K%P",
  "'Sorry for the wait.'%K%P",
  "'No worries.\\nStill though, you're getting pretty famous.'%K%P",
  "'Nah, come on, that was just coincidence, too.'%K%P",
  "She laughed it off, blushing,\\nbut I knew I was right.%K%P",
  "Akiba was a place packed with people and\\ngoddesses alike.%K%P",
  "It was just way too likely that someone would\\nhappen to notice her out in this crowd.%K%P",
  "And as if to prove as much...%K%P",
  "'Oh my god, is that Kagura?'%K%P",
  "'Wait, you mean the one who made it to the finals\\nin the Lâ˜†SEVEN auditions?'%K%P",
  "And just like that fan after fan kept picking her out\\nfrom the crowd...%K%P",
  "'Phew...'%K%P",
  "'Well, that was something.'%K%P",
  "I tried to change the subject after she had\\nspent so much time handling fans.%K%P",
  "By the time things finally settled down\\nit was already getting dark.%K%P",
  "'Ahahaha, I never expected that I would\\nrun into THAT many fans.'%K%P",
  "'It's just proof that your hard work up till now\\nis paying off.'%K%P",
  "'Sounds good when you put it that way.'%K%P",
  "'But it wasn't just me.\\nYou've helped me along the whole way.'%K%P",
  "She spoke with a smile on her face.%K%P",
  "I have to say, I was genuinely happy to hear\\nher say something like that.%K%P",
  "'No no no...\\nThis is all you and your charm.'%K%P",
  "'I'd say this should be enough of a boost\\nto help you through the end of auditions, huh?'%K%P",
  "'Yeah... Maybe.'\\nI'm glad we came out here today.'%K%P",
  "'Hey, Yamato...\\nThere's still just one more place I wanted to go...\\nDo you mind?'%K%P",
  "'Not at all. Where are we headed?'%K%P",
  "'Just follow me. You'll understand.'%K%P",
  "And with that she started off.\\nI just did as she said and followed along.%K%P",
  "'Okay, here we are.'%K%P",
  "'This is...'%K%P",
  "'Yup.\\nIt's the stage for the auditions tomorrow.'%K%P",
  "Right before our eyes was the special stage set up\\njust for the finals.%K%P",
  "This was where the goddesses would make\\ntheir final claim at stardom.%K%P",
  "'So, you see, I had a reason in mind for coming out\\nto Akiba today...'%K%P",
  "'I wanted to go on a date with you, of course.\\nBut I also wanted to double-check my feelings.'%K%P",
  "'Your feelings about...?'%K%P",
  "'Well... Just why I wanted to be an idol\\nin the first place...'%K%P",
  "'Tomorrow is the last day of auditions, so I just\\nwanted to come out here and remind myself of why.'%K%P",
  "She kept her eyes on the stage as she spoke.\\nI just stayed quiet, listening.%K%P",
  "'This place is where it all started.\\nWhere my life as an idol began...'%K%P",
  "'You know, the first time I came here I just couldn't\\nget over how wonderful a place it was.'%K%P",
  "'Why?'%K%P",
  "'Because everyone here, people and goddesses alike\\nall seemed to be having so much fun!'%K%P",
  "'As soon as I saw all those smiling faces, I knew.'%K%P",
  "'I knew I wanted to help people have even more fun.\\nAnd to smile even more than ever!'%K%P",
  "'So you decided to become an idol?'%K%P",
  "'Yep! And just at that very moment,\\nan Lâ˜†SEVEN ad played on the big monitor.'%K%P",
  "'I looked around and saw everyone watching with\\nstars in their eyes and smiles on their faces...'%K%P",
  "'And I knew I wanted to be like the girls on screen!'%K%P",
  "Her eyes were shining too, as she spoke.\\nEven her voice grew excited.%K%P",
  "'So I just wanted to come back out here to Akiba\\nand kind of relive those memories.'%K%P",
  "'So that's what this was all about, huh?'%K%P",
  "'I'm sorry we didn't get to really do any sort of\\ndate-y things.'%K%P",
  "'Don't worry about it.\\nI'm always here for you, no matter what.'%K%P",
  "'As long as you're working hard for it,\\nI'll support you every step of the way.'%K%P",
  "'Thanks, Yamato...'%K%P",
  "'I'm giving it all I've got tomorrow!'%K%P",
  "'And I'll do it because I want to be the one putting\\nsmiles on all their faces!'%K%P",
  "'I'm sure you'll make it.'%K%P",
  "I couldn't say anything more than that.%K%P",
  "But it didn't matter, because meeting up with fans\\ntoday was enough to make her shine.%K%P",
  "All the hard work that we put in seemed to have\\nreached people at last.%K%P",
  "'Alright! Bring on those auditions!\\nNothing can stop me now!'%K%P",
  "'That's the spirit!'%K%P",
  "I raised my hands\\nas I cheered her on.%K%P",
  "'Look at you, you're all excited too!'%K%P",
  "'Of course.\\nExcitement is the key ingredient for this stuff.'%K%P",
  "'Hahaha, I guess you're right!'%K%P",
  "The two of us finally had a\\ngood laugh with each other.%K%P",
  "We were both more than pumped.\\nHeading out to Akiba was a good idea after all.%K%P",
  "And absolutely what we needed.%K%P",
  "'Okay, but...\\nWhy this, then?'%K%P",
  "'Tomorrow's the main audition, right?\\nI can't handle the stress alone.'%K%P",
  "On our way home from our date she suddenly asked me\\nif she could spend the night.%K%P",
  "I didn't have any real reason to say no,\\nand was more than happy to have her, but...%K%P",
  "'Okay, that's all fine and good,\\nbut do you need to cling to me?'%K%P",
  "'Hehehe, well...\\nWe didn't get to do much today,\\nso I figured I had to make up for it!'%K%P",
  "She explained herself briefly\\nas she came in for more kisses.%K%P",
  "'Wait...\\nYou do like doing this with me, right?'%K%P",
  "'Of course I do.'%K%P",
  "I responded in record time.%K%P",
  "If we were really being honest,\\nI'd have asked for more!%K%P",
  "'Alright then. You asked for it.\\nNow I'm gonna go all out!'%K%P",
  "'Kyaah!'%K%P"
