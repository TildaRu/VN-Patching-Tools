  "'Just calm down, okay?'%K%P",
  "'How can you expect me to be calm?!'%K%P",
  "Kagura snapped back at me.%K%P",
  "We'd both been working so hard the last few days.\\nI could understand her frustration.%K%P",

  "'...So I was just a bonus that came with Shuri?'%K%P",
  "'What are you talking about?\\nYou know that's not true.'%K%P",
  "'But I could never have passed the preliminaries\\non my own.'%K%P",
  "'Sure, but neither could Shuri.\\nYou both passed because\\nyour strengths complemented each other.%K%P",
  "'You really think so...?'%K%P",
  "'I know so.'%K%P",

  "'Isn't it? What is 'like me', then?'%K%P",

  "'But it sounds like that's exactly why\\nso many people don't like me...'%K%P",
  "'Kagura, get a hold of yourself.\\nSure it's important to have a good online following,\\nbut it's not everything.'%K%P",
  "'If you let yourself get this depressed over\\na few nasty comments, it's not going to get easier.'%K%P",
  "'Yeah, I know that but...'%K%P",
  "'And you're definitely not just an add-on for Shuri.\\nThat much, I can guarantee.'%K%P",
  "'You have a charm that's all your own.\\nIt's only a matter of time until everyone realizes.'%K%P",
  "'Yamato...'%K%P",
  "I looked Kagura right in the eyes as I spoke.\\nAnd I had meant every single word.%K%P",
  "'You'd never have passed the preliminaries if\\nyou were nothing more than a bonus, right?'%K%P",
