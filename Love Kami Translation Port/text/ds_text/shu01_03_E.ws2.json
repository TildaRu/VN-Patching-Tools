  "'Whoa, that's quite a crowd!'%K%P",
  "I turned up at the usual park\\njust as Shuri was about to start practice.%K%P",
  "'What are you going to do? Go ahead and start?'%K%P",
  "'Of course. Everyone here is a Love☆Kami fan, right?\\nSo some of them must like Kagura more than me.'%K%P",
  "'Which means this is a chance to win some new fans!'%K%P",
  "She clearly intended to steal some of Kagura's fans.\\nNow that they were going head to head,\\nShuri was showing no mercy.%K%P",
  "'It's not like the number of fans matters\\nin the final vote, why go that far?'%K%P",
  "'What are you talking about?\\nFor Divine Idols, fans equal power!'%K%P",
  "'Oh, right, Sakimitama and all that...'%K%P",
  "Goddesses' power depends on the quality\\nand amount of Sakimitama they get.%K%P",
  "The more fans a Divine Idol has,\\nthe better a performance she can give.%K%P",
  "The reason L☆SEVEN stays so dominant\\nis largely due to the power they've gained\\nfrom their fans.%K%P",
  "And with that power they can give better\\nperformances than anyone else,\\nmaking them basically untouchable.%K%P",
  "'I know Kagura's doing the same thing at\\nAmano Kaguyama, so she's not losing out too much.%K%P",
  "'But having said that, it's not exactly fair\\nfor me to get help from you, either.\\nSorry, but you just stand over there and watch, OK?'%K%P",
  "'OK then, here I go!'%K%P",
  "Shuri went out and started dancing for her fans.%K%P",
  "Even this park in the backstreets of Akihabara\\nwas a stage to her.%K%P",
  "She used to be so shy, but now\\nshe can stand proudly in front of anyone.%K%P",
  "It's hard to notice, being so close all the time,\\nbut she's really growing up.%K%P",
  "'Phew, I worked up a good sweat there.'%K%P",
  "Practice finished, Shuri could finally\\ncatch a breather.%K%P",
  "I handed her a sports drink, which she drank gladly.%K%P",
  "'OK then...'%K%P",
  "Still holding the bottle,\\nshe deftly tapped at her phone.%K%P",
  "'...'%K%P",
  "'What's wrong?'%K%P",
  "'Um... It's nothing...'%K%P",
  "The last few days, Shuri had been\\nchecking her phone a lot.%K%P",
  "Whenever she did she always ended up looking sad,\\nso Kagura and I were getting worried.%K%P",
  "'Have you found a boyfriend?'%K%P",
  "'Of course not! How rude!'%K%P",
  "'Is that rude?'%K%P",
  "'Of course it's rude!\\nDo you think I'd do something dumb like fall in love\\nwith the audition coming up?'%K%P",
  "'Well, when you put it that way...'%K%P",
  "'But, just so you know, being a Divine Idol\\ndoesn't mean we can't date and stuff.'%K%P",
  "'I'm just saying\\nnow isn't the time for stuff like that, is all.'%K%P",
  "Shuri is pretty picky about this kind of thing.%K%P",
  "She can be kind of uptight like a class captain,\\nand sometimes acts super serious.%K%P",
  "She's the complete opposite of carefree Kagura,\\nbut that's why they worked as a duo,\\neach had what the other didn't.%K%P",
  "'I'm only telling because I hate misunderstandings,\\nbut I'm texting with my sister.'%K%P",
  "Shuri's sister is Bishamonten,\\na member of L☆SEVEN.%K%P",
  "'I think I already told you,\\nbut I entered this audition without telling her.'%K%P",
  "'I finally told her about it,\\nbut she hasn't replied.'%K%P",
  "'She's probably just too busy to answer.'%K%P",
  "'I don't think so.\\nShe's got time when she's going between places,\\nit's not that hard to send a reply.'%K%P",
  "'...Well, that is kind of worrying then.'%K%P",
  "'I wonder what's going on with her...'%K%P",
  "'I'll try asking Sara if she knows anything.'%K%P",
  "I can't get directly involved in the audition,\\nbut I'd like to help out where I can.%K%P",
  "As the unofficial third member of Love☆Kami,\\nI want to stay involved somehow.%K%P",
  "But that evening, before I could ask Sara,\\nI got a message from Shuri.%K%P",
  "[My sister answered.]%K%P",
  "[I'm sorry I worried you.\\nEverything's okay now.]%K%P",
  "'Well, I'm glad it worked out at least.'%K%P",
  "I bet Shuri was relieved to hear from her sister.%K%P",
  "Now she can focus on practicing to get ready\\nfor the audition.%K%P"
