  "The next month was over in the blink of an eye.%K%P",
  "The five goddesses who'd passed through the\\npreliminaries were fighting to be number one,\\nand everyone was watching to see how it went.%K%P",
  "Shuri and Kagura worked out their own unique styles,\\nand were apparently doing really well.%K%P",
  "As I stood back and watched the two of them chase\\ntheir dreams, I went through my own life in a daze.%K%P",
  "Sara came by now and then to get away from things,\\nbut I really wasn't much help.%K%P",
  "And so, the day of the final audition arrived.%K%P",
  "I was supposed to go to the show and cheer them on,\\nbut I watched the live stream from home instead.%K%P",
  "'Oh, that's too bad...'%K%P",
  "They both gave the performances of their lives,\\nbut Shuri and Kagura were outclassed.%K%P",
  "In the end, the winner was the popular front runner,\\nwho had taken first place in the qualifying round.%K%P",
  "'They both did so well, but she was\\njust on another level.'%K%P",
  "The difference in ability was just too great to\\novercome in such a short time.%K%P",
  "Shuri and Kagura had worked hard,\\nbut so had all the other competitors.%K%P",
  "'Oh well...'%K%P",
  "The results of the audition had been confirmed.%K%P",
  "After that, they would have the award ceremony,\\nand then the winner would greet everyone\\nas the new member of L☆SEVEN.%K%P",
  "'...'%K%P",
  "I closed my browser without\\nbothering to watch the end.%K%P",
  "It was a little early, but I figured I'd go to sleep.%K%P",
  "I certainly wasn't just going to sulk in bed.%K%P",
  "I just had a lot to think about,\\nand I wanted to be alone.%K%P",
  "Or that was the plan, but...%K%P",
  "'Ugh... Be quiet and let me sleep!'%K%P",
  "My phone was a storm of buzzing notifications.%K%P",
  "Shuri was apparently trying to get hold of me\\nby any means possible.%K%P",
  "Kagura didn't have a phone,\\nbut Shuri made up for it with extra vigor.%K%P",
  "[We're on our way there right now!\\nYou wait right there, mister!]%K%P",
  "It seemed I'd done something to incur their wrath...%K%P",
  "'Now maybe you can explain why\\nyou didn't come to the show?'%K%P",
  "As soon as they arrived,\\nShuri started the interrogation.%K%P",
  "'Now, I'm not saying it's your fault we lost,\\nbut don't you think it's pretty crappy that you\\ndidn't even come to watch us?'%K%P",
  "Shockingly, even Kagura was angry.%K%P",
  "She didn't really look it,\\nbut this is what angry Kagura looked like.%K%P",
  "'Come on, you two, don't be so angry.\\nLet's hear him out first.'%K%P",
  "It looks like they'd involved Sara as well,\\nsince she'd come with them.%K%P",
  "'I'm sorry, Sara.\\nIt looks like I've got you caught up in something.'%K%P",
  "'Don't worry about it.\\nBut I can't really say I'm happy you didn't come.'%K%P",
  "'...'%K%P",
  "'So what's your reason for not coming?\\nSurely you didn't oversleep or something?'%K%P",
  "'Is it because you couldn't decide\\nwhich of us to root for?'%K%P",
  "'No, that's not it. I just...'%K%P",
  "'I didn't want to see Sara retire.'%K%P",
  "After the audition was over,\\nand they'd decided on the new member,\\nit would be time for Sara to retire.%K%P",
  "She would basically be passing the baton to\\nthe new member and then leaving L☆SEVEN.%K%P",
  "I didn't want to watch that happen.%K%P",
  "'Yamato...'%K%P",
  "'Okay, fine. That sounds like a good reason.'%K%P",
  "'I understand how you feel.\\nI didn't want to watch it, either.'%K%P",
  "'I'm sorry I wasn't there to support you two.'%K%P",
  "My reluctance to watch Sara leave was stronger\\nthan my desire to go and root for them.%K%P",
  "I was being selfish, but they seemed to understand.%K%P",
  "'Hmmm...'%K%P",
  "Sara stayed behind after Shuri and Kagura had left.%K%P",
  "She even followed me back to my room.%K%P",
  "'Are you still mad at me?'%K%P",
  "'Of course I am!\\nYou put me ahead of Shuri and Kagura...'%K%P",
  "'That's not what I meant to do.\\nI just couldn't bear to see it...'%K%P",
  "'Ugh, you're so stupid sometimes!'%K%P",
  "Sara gently wrapped her arms around me.%K%P",
  "It was different from her usual teasing\\nsqueeze, more tender somehow.%K%P",
  "'I knew it, you're still thinking about that night.'%K%P",
  "'I can't deny it...'%K%P",
  "'Even after I kept telling you\\nthat it wasn't your fault?'%K%P",
  "'But...'%K%P",
  "'Enough... Don't say anything.'%K%P",
  "She kept holding me, unmoving.%K%P",
  "The warmth and scent of her were strangely soothing.%K%P",
  "'Thank you for caring.'%K%P",
  "She whispered.%K%P",
  "I understood, but I couldn't answer.%K%P",
  "'Okay, that's enough.'%K%P",
  "'I'm truly grateful that you care so much about me,\\nbut you're not off the hook yet for how you\\ntreated Shuri and Kagura.'%K%P",
  "'I'm really mad at you!'%K%P",
  "And in a sudden 180,\\nI was now on the receiving end of\\nan intense scolding.%K%P",
  "She went on berating me for\\nnot going to support them, and somehow I ended up\\nbowed on my knees in penance.%K%P",
  " I guess it went on for about 15 minutes.\\nOnly once I had started losing feeling in my legs\\ndid she decide to set me loose.%K%P",
  "'So... You really did quit\\nbeing a Divine Idol, didn't you...?'%K%P",
  "'I did. It was only for about a year,\\nbut I do feel kind of lonely.'%K%P",
  "'What are you going to do next?'%K%P",
  "I hadn't wanted to face her retirement,\\nso I'd never asked her what she'd planned.%K%P",
  "'Well, I won't be a Divine Idol,\\nbut I'm going to continue working in\\nthe entertainment industry.'%K%P",
  "'Well, I say continue, but it might be better to say\\nI can't escape...'%K%P",
  "Sara smiled sadly.%K%P",
  "Since she'd been such a huge star,\\neven after quitting the idol world she'd still\\nhave a lot of appeal.%K%P",
  "'So what about the singing problem?'%K%P",
  "'Well, I can't sing, so I'm planning on\\ngetting some other kind of work.'%K%P",
  "'I can't imagine you not there,\\nsinging at the center of L☆SEVEN...'%K%P",
  "'Well, eventually you'll get used to it.\\nSo just wait and see for now.'%K%P"
