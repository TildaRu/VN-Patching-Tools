  "As a Divine Idol who'd made\\nit through the preliminaries,\\nShuri was getting a lot of attention.%K%P",
  "Fans were starting to gather to watch her practice.%K%P",
  "She was right, of course. If I started talking\\nto her like I was someone special, I could cause\\nsome serious problems for her.%K%P",
  "'So I guess this means I'm out of the picture.'%K%P",
  "I set down the fan goods and left.%K%P",

  "What did I used to do before I met those two?%K%P",
  "It wasn't that long ago, but I couldn't remember.%K%P",
  "'Hellooo... Oh, uh, knock-knock.'%K%P",
  "Sara came in, then thought twice\\nand knocked on the door behind her.%K%P",
  "'Sara... If you're going to knock, try to do it\\nbefore you come in.'%K%P",
  "You don't even need to say 'knock-knock'.%K%P",

  "'So is it okay if I just hang out here for a while?'%K%P",
  "'It's fine with me, if you don't mind the place.'%K%P",
  "'Mmmm... Yamato, you're so sweet!\\nCome on, let big sis give you a squeeze.'%K%P",
  "'Quit messing around.\\nI am a guy, you know.'%K%P",
  "'Sorry, sorry, I guess I tease you a bit too much.'%K%P",
  "'Try to have a little more self-awareness, okay?'%K%P",
  "I just blurted it out, and then immediately realized\\nwhat I'd said.%K%P",
  "'What do you mean... Self-awareness? In what way?'%K%P",

  "'I was just thinking...\\nI had forgotten that you're a boy...'%K%P",
  "'Well, I don't think I look like\\na girl or anything...'%K%P",
