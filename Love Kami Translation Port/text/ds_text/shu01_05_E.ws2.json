  "Whenever I had free time I went by the practice spot.%K%P",
  "Kagura usually worked afternoons,\\nso she couldn't come.\\nSo I pretty much only ever watched Shuri practice.%K%P",
  "'...'%K%P",
  "Today she was dance training, no singing.%K%P",
  "She was wearing her school uniform,\\nnot her idol costume.%K%P",
  "Shuri herself knew that Kagura was a better dancer,\\nso she was working on that weak point.%K%P",
  "*Pant*puff*gasp*%K%P",
  "'Good work. Here's your towel.'%K%P",
  "'Th-Thanks.'%K%P",
  "Shuri wiped herself down, still out of breath.%K%P",
  "'You're really working hard today.\\nThat dance was smoking.'%K%P",
  "'I'm nowhere near ready.\\nKagura can do better without breaking a sweat'%K%P",
  "'You may be right.\\nBut really, do you have to aim that high?'%K%P",
  "'Of course I do!'%K%P",
  "Shuri's voice grew rough.%K%P",
  "She was worn out, body and mind.%K%P",
  "'It's good to work hard, but don't overdo it.\\nIf you hurt yourself, you'll be out of the audition.'%K%P",
  "'I know, I know.'%K%P",
  "She hadn't even caught her breath,\\nbut she went back to practice.%K%P",
  "Shuri seemed somehow savage,\\nlike she was being driven by something.%K%P",
  "'Heyyy, Shuriii!'%K%P",
  "It was evening, and Kagura came by after work.%K%P",
  "'It looks like you're really practicing hard!\\nOur customers are even talking about it.'%K%P",
  "Shuri had practiced from morning till evening.\\nI don't think she'd practiced so long\\neven during the qualifier.%K%P",
  "'People are starting to talk huh?\\nBut even so, there isn't much of an audience here.'%K%P",
  "'Apparently it's way too serious around here,\\npeople are scared to come.'%K%P",
  "'Shuri, you looked kinda scary just now...\\nCome on, give us a smile!'%K%P",
  "'What was it you said?\\nDivine Idols are always supposed to smile?'%K%P",
  "'Exactly!\\nOh, I worked so hard to teach you,\\nand you already forgot?'%K%P",
  "Shuri had always smiled performing on the streets,\\nbut that was because she honestly enjoyed it.%K%P",
  "She hadn't been very good at flashing\\nher smile at fans as a Divine Idol, though.%K%P",
  "I remember clearly how that\\nhad been a problem when they first formed their duo\\nand Kagura had really trained her on it.%K%P",
  "'Kagura, did you come to practice?\\nIf so, I'll switch out.'%K%P",
  "'What, you're just going to go home?\\nCome one, we're here together,\\nlet's be Love☆Kami again for a while!'%K%P",
  "'If it's just for a little while, why not?\\nYou could even help each others' weak points.'%K%P",
  "Unfortunately, explaining little details of technique\\nwas beyond me.%K%P",
  "Shuri must have realized this,\\nsince she simply agreed to the suggestion.%K%P",
  "'Alright then! Let's gooo!'%K%P",
  "'Start the music!'%K%P",
  "They took their poses,\\nthen started dancing in unison.%K%P",
  "After all their practice as a duo,\\nShuri and Kagura were in perfect sync.%K%P",
  "Love☆Kami wasn't fading.%K%P",
  "That made me so happy, I couldn't stop watching them.%K%P",
  "'You two were great out there.'%K%P",
  "When they finished their song,\\nI offered some words of encouragement.%K%P",
  "But Kagura didn't look at me,\\nshe was staring at Shuri, troubled.%K%P",
  "'...Shuri, what was that supposed to be?'%K%P",
  "'What are you talking about,\\nI didn't make a single mistake.'%K%P",
  "'Didn't I just tell you again?\\nA Divine Idol is always supposed to smile!'%K%P",
  "'Anyone can dance and sing if they practice. But\\nputting her heart and soul into it and smiling\\nis what makes a Divine Idol!%K%P",
  "Shuri, you didn't do that at all just now!'%K%P",
  "'But this was just practice, is it really necessary?'%K%P",
  "'She has to do it because it's practice!\\nIf she can't do it now,\\nhow can she do it when it's showtime?'%K%P",
  "Kagura was right.%K%P",
  "You have to treat practice like it's the real deal.%K%P",
  "Even if there isn't anyone there to watch,\\nyou have to perform like there's an audience.%K%P",
  "'If you perform like that, no one'll have any fun.\\nNo one will want to support you.'%K%P",
  "'...I'm sorry.'%K%P",
  "'Don't do it half-assed just because it's practice.\\nOr are you going to tell me that was\\nthe best you could do?'%K%P",
  "'Ungh...'%K%P",
  "'We've got a real chance now, let's really go for it!\\nRight, Shuri?'%K%P",
  "'Yeah...'%K%P",
  "Even after Kagura tried to cheer her up,\\nShuri still couldn't smile.%K%P",
  "The more she focused on it, the harder it became.%K%P",
  "Shuri's expression grew even more grim,\\nand that smile she used to have on the streets\\nwas nowhere to be seen.%K%P",
  "'OK then, I guess let's call it a day...'%K%P",
  "'Good work out there!'%K%P",
  "It was getting late, so they wrapped up practice\\nand went their separate ways.%K%P",
  "But Shuri just stood there messing with her phone.%K%P",
  "'Shuri, aren't you going home?'%K%P",
  "'Oh, uh, no. I'm going to stick around for a bit.'%K%P",
  "'Don't get hooked on those games, okay?\\nYou'll start to forget to practice!'%K%P",
  "'Got it.'%K%P",
  "Shuri answered, but she didn't look at Kagura.%K%P",
  "'...Okay then, bye.\\nYamato, walk me home?'%K%P",
  "'Oh, yeah, okay.'%K%P",
  "I was worried about Shuri,\\nbut Kagura pulled me away and we left.%K%P",
  "'Hey, do you think Shuri's alright?'%K%P",
  "Kagura asked with a worried look,\\nafter finally letting go of my arm.%K%P",
  "'She's always got that mad look on her face.\\nShe's not the same old lovable Shuri anymore.'%K%P",
  "'Yeah, there's something weird going on.\\nI wonder what happened?'%K%P",
  "'She's not really one\\nto talk about her private life, is she?\\nShe always gets angry when I ask.'%K%P",
  "Shuri had always kept people from\\ngetting too deep into her affairs.%K%P",
  "That's why Kagura was so afraid to ask now.%K%P",
  "'Whatever happened, she can't keep going like this.\\nI think there's going to be big trouble\\nif we don't do something.'%K%P",
  "'So, could you maybe keep a close eye on her?%K%P",
  "'Well, yeah, but I'm already doing that.'%K%P",
  "'You're watching out for\\nShuri the Divine Idol, right?\\nThat's not what I'm talking about...'%K%P",
  "'I want you to look out for the girl,\\nShuri Kisshouten.'%K%P",
  "'As her friend, I really want to help her myself,\\nbut right now I think Shuri sees me as an opponent.\\nI doubt she'd open up to me.'%K%P",
  "'So I'm asking you, Yamato.\\nBe there for her.'%K%P",
  "'Right.\\nShuri is important to me, too.\\nI'll watch out for her for both our sakes.'%K%P",
  "'I'm counting on you.\\nAnd if things start feeling right,\\nyou can go kiss her if you like.'%K%P",
  "'Where did that come from?!'%K%P",
  "'Well, you are a guy.\\nWith that kind of incentive, you'll try harder.'%K%P",
  "'Why you... But, you're not wrong...'%K%P",
  "'Hehehe...\\nThis is fun since they're not my own lips.'%K%P",
  "'...Wait till Shuri hears that.'%K%P",
  "'Oh, no, wait, come on!\\nIf you tell Shuri I said that\\nshe'll seriously kill me!'%K%P",
  "'I'm just joking! Thank you for worrying about her.\\nIt really makes me glad.'%K%P",
  "'You're sounding like her boyfriend for real.'%K%P",
  "'You're one to talk.\\nThe two of us are turning into her guardian angels.'%K%P",
  "'Oh, she really can be a pain,\\nour prickly little princess.'%K%P",
  "'Just between us, that's kind of her best point.'%K%P",
  "'It really is.\\nIt's so cute how she can't just admit how she feels.\\nIt's almost cheating.'%K%P",
  "Clearly, Kagura and I were\\nin agreement about Shuri's charms.%K%P",
  "But of course, that wasn't the issue.\\nI had to watch out for her,\\nas she was clearly going through trouble.%K%P",
  "'I guess I'm really not ready yet...'%K%P",
  "Kagura had really struck a nerve at practice today.%K%P",
  "She was probably much better suited\\nto being a Divine Idol than I ever could be.%K%P",
  "She always thought about how to put\\nfans and their enjoyment first,\\nand it genuinely made her happy.%K%P",
  "'...Kagura might not realize it herself,\\nbut she's a really tough opponent.'%K%P",
  "Clearly, singing and dancing could only go so far.%K%P",
  "So the better I got, the more important it became\\nto find some other way to compete.%K%P",
  "There was something about Kagura that charmed people.\\nSomething special, that I didn't have.%K%P",
  "'But that just means that as an average goddess,\\nI'll have to try harder than anyone else!'%K%P",
  "I could practice harder than anyone.\\nKagura was working on her skills at work, too.%K%P",
  "We were both still amateurs,\\nand so that would be our real contest.\\nSo that's what I'd have to bet it all on!%K%P",
  "'I don't have any time to spare.\\nI have to keep practicing.'%K%P",
  "I started practicing again in the darkened park.%K%P",
  "'I can't smile, so the darkness suits me just fine.'%K%P",
  "I can't smile.\\nSmiling is for Kagura.%K%P",
  "Wanting to forget that truth for a moment,\\nI danced in the darkness.%K%P",
  "In the sleepless Akihabara streets, this is where\\nI found the darkness that I needed.%K%P",
  "'I get it... All of it...'%K%P",
  "I knew without Kagura having to tell me.%K%P",
  "But just like people,\\ngoddesses couldn't change in an instant.%K%P",
  "All I could do was to keep living life\\nto its fullest, right now.%K%P"
