  "'Hey, we get another chance to perform together!\\nSo just grin and bear it!'%K%P",

  "'Well, you'd better get used to it, Shuri!'%K%P",
  "After the audition was over,\\nShuri and Kagura went back to their normal lives.%K%P",
  "But they still managed to keep\\ntheir Divine Idol duo Love☆Kami going.%K%P",
  "It was unfortunate neither of them had been chosen\\nto join L☆SEVEN, but some day they might be able to\\njoin them on stage as Love☆Kami.%K%P",

  "L☆SEVEN had started performing with their\\nnew seventh member, and people were getting more and\\nmore excited, even without Sara there.%K%P",
  "The hardcore fans still grieved her retirement,\\nbut who knew how long that would last?%K%P",

  "'You could just refuse.\\nYou shouldn't just say yes to everything.'%K%P",
  "'Oh, but I enjoy watching the shop!'%K%P",
  "Even if that was a lie, Sara did seem to be\\nin a particularly good mood today.%K%P",
  "'Hey, hey, do you know what's for dinner tonight?'%K%P",
  "'It's CURRYYY!\\nAren't you happy to hear that?!'%K%P",
  "'Not nearly as happy as you seem to be...'%K%P",
  "'Heehee, she said I could have anything I wanted,\\nso that was my request.'%K%P",
  "'I figured as much...'%K%P",
  "Up to now, I'd never had a chance to find out\\nwhat Sara liked.%K%P",
  "But in the last few days, I'd learned.\\nSara was crazy for curry.%K%P",
  "She said it was written right there on her\\nwebsite profile page, but, well...%K%P",
  "'I wonder...Will it be beef?\\nOr pork? Or could it be chicken?'%K%P",
  "'You didn't tell her what kind of meat to use?'%K%P",
  "'I wanted to leave that a surprise.\\nYour mom's such a good cook, it'll be great\\nno matter what she uses!'%K%P",
  "She seemed to have a lot of faith in\\nmy mother's cooking skills.%K%P",
  "Ever since she retired from being a Divine Idol,\\nSara had come by whenever her work allowed.%K%P",
  "Which was much more often than before.%K%P",
  "My mother liked Sara, so she spoiled her rotten,\\nand always invited her to have dinner with us.%K%P",
  "And Sara always asked for curry.%K%P",
  "'The smell will get into the kimonos,\\nso you might want to hold back on\\noverly fragrant foods...'%K%P",
  "'Well, naturally she's being careful of that.\\nWhen she's cooking, the smell doesn't make it\\nin here at all.'%K%P",
  "She said this almost regretfully.%K%P",
  "A curry-scented kimono shop sounded like\\na terrible thing to me.%K%P",
  "'Ugh... I'm so full...'%K%P",
  "Sara had eaten too much curry for dinner,\\nand now she was suffering for it.%K%P",
  "And once again, she was using my bed without asking,\\nbut she looked so pathetic, I didn't have\\nthe heart to tell her off.%K%P",
  "'You shouldn't get so excited and force yourself\\nto have seconds or thirds.'%K%P",
  "'Oh, but it's so delicious!'%K%P",
  "She was so thin, I couldn't imagine where all that\\ncurry had gone.%K%P",
  "Maybe a goddess' stomach was built differently\\nfrom humans?%K%P",
  "'I honestly can't believe you like curry that much.'%K%P",
  "'It's such a wonderful thing!\\nIt's delicious and healthy!'%K%P",
  "While I couldn't deny what she said,\\nthat wasn't the issue.%K%P",
  "'Yeah, but everyone's got their limits,\\nno matter how much they like something.'%K%P",
  "'It's hard to believe you were a Divine Idol until\\njust recently, the way you stuff your belly\\nwith that stuff.'%K%P",
  "'I know, I know.\\nI never thought I was cut out to be an idol anyway.'%K%P",
  "'Are you serious...?'%K%P",
  "'Of course.\\nI much prefer being on variety shows.'%K%P",
  "Sara got up from bed and looked me\\nsquare in the face while she said this.%K%P",
  "'It's much more interesting,\\nI can be on quiz shows and do food reports,\\nall kinds of stuff.'%K%P",
  "'Look, see?\\nThey sent me to a hot spring last time!'%K%P",
  "Sara showed me a picture she took on her phone.%K%P",
  "It showed her playing around in front of\\nan outdoor bath.%K%P",
  "'It won't be broadcasted for a while,\\nbut the water was sooo nice!'%K%P",
  "'And the food was wonderful, too.\\nI wonder if it's okay to have this much fun at work?'%K%P",
  "Sara was getting all worked up.%K%P",
  "But the more excited she got,\\nthe colder I felt.%K%P",
  "'Sara... That's no good.'%K%P",
  "'Yamato...?'%K%P",
  "'I want you to sing again.\\nYou're not yourself when you aren't singing.'%K%P",
  "I blurted it out without thinking.%K%P",
  "Even though I knew it was a cruel thing to say,\\nI couldn't help myself.%K%P",
  "'I know that. I do...'%K%P",
  "'I want to sing! But I just can't...'%K%P",
  "'I feel like singing, and my mouth starts to move...\\nBut my voice just won't come out...'%K%P",
  "Sara hadn't gotten her voice back.%K%P",
  "'Even songs other than love songs?\\nYou should be fine with songs that\\naren't about romance.'%K%P",
  "'Well, it should be like that.\\nBut it just doesn't work.'%K%P",
  "'I feel like I've betrayed everyone who ever listened\\nto my singing. That feeling is like a knife in my\\nchest, and I just can't sing like I used to.'%K%P",
  "She used to sing about love without ever\\nhaving felt it.%K%P",
  "For Sara, that was the same as lying,\\nand so she felt like she's betrayed her fans.%K%P",
  "I felt like she was just over-thinking it.%K%P",
  "But for her, it was important to sing from the heart,\\nand she could never change that.%K%P",
  "She went so far as to quit singing,\\nsomething she loved, but she couldn't lie to herself\\nonce she'd noticed what she was doing.%K%P",
  "'Well... If you experienced love,\\ncould you sing again?'%K%P",
  "'I don't know.\\nBut, I think maybe I could.'%K%P",
  "'Well, if that's the case,\\nthen you should learn what love is!'%K%P",
  "As I went on, Sara looked at me with\\na puzzled look first.%K%P",
  "But soon, her eyes filled with excitement.%K%P",
  "'You're right... If you don't know what something is,\\nyou just have to learn about it.%K%P",
  "When I figure out what it means to know love,\\nthen I'll understand it all better!'%K%P",
  "'Thank you, Yamato!\\nAgain, you've helped me realize something important.'%K%P",
  "'I know it might not be the best occasion,\\nbut I have one more favor to ask.'%K%P",
  "'Please, Yamato... Teach me what love is.'%K%P"
